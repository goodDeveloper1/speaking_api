            "Do you work or are you a student?<br><arrow>After I left school, I got a degree in nursing, and I've been working as a staff nurse for almost 10 years now. Currently, I'm working at Manilamed, one the best medical centres here in Manila. As a staff nurse, I'm responsible for lots of different things such as preparing patients for examinations and surgery, observing and recording their conditions, measuring and recording their vital signs and weight, administering medications, preparing rooms, cleaning and disinfecting equipment and instruments, or assisting doctors during surgery. Plus, every day I perform a wide range of tasks to provide care to my patients and resolve their problems. For instance, I feed patients who cannot feed themselves, dress patients with physical challenges, help ambulatory patients walk, turn bedridden patients to prevent pressure sores, sometimes I have to transport patients. You see, there's no such thing as a routine day in a hospital, and you just never know what to expect. It's a very tough job, but I like it. (You can find a video featuring this answer on our YouTube channel called IELTS Speaking Assistant, playlist SAMPLE ANSWERS)",
            "Why did you choose that job?<br><arrow>Well, I guess the primary reason why I decided to pursue a career in Finance was that <u>I really loved Maths at school as I was always good at numbers</u>. And because of this, <u>I thought it was the only possible choice I could make</u>. So it wasn't a tough decision. And, thank God, I have never regretted it.",
            "(for people who love challenges) Do you like your job?<br><arrow>Yeah I do. What I love the most about my job is that <u>it never gets boring</u>. Mainly because <u>I have an opportunity to take on new challenges all the time</u>, which I really like. In fact, the more challenging the task or the project, the more I like it. You know, if I could do the work with my eyes closed, I swear I would die of boredom, and I would quit my job even though it pays really well. So every time my boss gives me a new challenging task, I feel totally psyched. You know, there is just something beautiful about encountering obstacles and finding ways to overcome them. And then every time I finish a difficult project or task successfully, I feel like I’m flying. My confidence skyrockets and I feel proud of myself, which helps me grow both professionally and personally, and expand my comfort zone. (You can find the video featuring this answer on our YouTube channel called IELTS Speaking Assistant, playlist SAMPLE ANSWERS)",
            "What do you like about your studies?<br><arrow>I will probably sound a bit nerdy, but I’m happy that school <u>provides me with an opportunity to acquire knowledge</u> about things I didn’t know before. I guess that <u>most subjects, we are taught, will help us to succeed in the future</u>. So I never miss lessons and complete all the assignments on time.",
            "What do you dislike about your studies?<br><arrow>As a high school student, I can safely say that I dislike school very strongly mainly because <u>the teachers pile so much work onto us</u> that we hardly get 5 hours of sleep a night during an average school week. You see, no matter when I go to bed, I <u>have to wake up early</u> because my classes usually start at 8 am. To top it off, <u>most subjects are boring and irrelevant to our future careers</u>. So it causes a lot of stress, making me and my fellow students reluctant to study.",
            "What was your dream job when you were young?<br><arrow>Oh, when I was younger, I wanted to either become <u>a CEO of a big company or be self-employed</u>. I was really sure that this would bring me <u>an adequate remuneration</u> and, as a result, <u>a sense of satisfaction</u>. What is more, I understood that <u>I was good at problem-solving and managing people, could take on responsibility and  work under pressure</u>, which was very important for <u>pursuing such careers</u>."

It is an interesting fact, taking into account that Russia is the largest country in the world. <u>The second most populated city is</u> St.Petersburg. Both Moscow and St.Petersburg are attractive to people because there are more jobs on offer than in other cities in Russia.",
            "Where is your country located?<br><arrow>Well, I’m not very good at geography, but from what I remember India is <u>located in southeast Asia, sharing the border with 6 or 7 countries in the north</u>.

China is <u>one of the world’s biggest producers of toys, textiles, apparel, electronic</u>… you name it. Also, <u>the country’s economy relies heavily on agriculture</u>. <u>The dominant agricultural product is, undoubtedly, rice</u>. Besides, <u>China grows wheat, tobacco, potatoes, peanuts, soybeans, corn, tea and oilseeds</u>. ",
            "What are some of the good things and some of the bad things about living in your country?<br><arrow>I think the greatest problem is <u>poverty<u>. Many people have so <u>low incomes<u> that they can hardly make ends meet. Some of them <u>cannot afford even basic needs like food and housing<u>. This makes people resort to <u>committing crimes in a desperate attempt to survive<u>.  However, the good bit is that there are signs that the economy is recovering and the government is taking measures to fight poverty. So, things will probably improve soon. "

Plus, there are no stains in shower, tub or sink fixtures. There are no crumbs or dirt on the floor. My sink is always empty and clean - there are never dirty dishes in it. And what's important is that everything has a place and is in the place it belongs. I'd say my home is clean enough for guests to visit unexpectedly.",
            "What housework do you dislike?<br><arrow>What I hate is vacuuming! I think it's because of the noise and monotonous nature of pushing a vacuum around. It just gets on my nerves and bores me to death. Another reason why I hate doing this chore is that I don't like having to move furniture and reach into all the far corners of my house. Plus, every time I vacuum, dust and pet dander get stirred up into the air and make me sneeze and itch. So it's not only a chore that I dread, but it also causes me physical discomfort.",
            "What housework do you like?<br><arrow>It may sound weird, but I love washing the dishes. It's one of my favorite chores! First of all, doing repetitive motions is calming. I would even say it's therapeutic to me. And I normally use this time to practice mindfulness. I mean, I try to focus on the task at hand, and it helps me clear my mind and relax. Plus, I enjoy listening to the soft sounds of the water running and the gentle clinking of dishes against each other as I wash them. It's like a mini-meditation session for me. ",
            "Do you often do housework?<br><arrow>Well, I do it <u>quite often</u>. For example, I cook <u>day by day</u> 'cause I like to treat my family to fresh, healthy food. Unfortunately, I can't do all the housework <u>daily</u> but I do my best <u>to keep my apartment clean and in good condition</u>. ",
            "Do you have breakfast at home every day?<br><arrow>No, I don't always have breakfast at home. Sometimes I'm in a rush and I'll grab something quick on the go, like a granola bar or a piece of fruit. Other times, I'll stop at a cafe and get something more substantial, like a breakfast sandwich or a bowl of oatmeal. It just depends on my schedule and what I'm in the mood for.",
            "Do you want to learn how to cook well?<br><arrow>Yeah, I'd love to. If I learn to cook like a pro, I will be able to experiment with different flavors, ingredients, and cooking techniques to create dishes that are truly unique and tailored specifically towards my tastes and preferences. But, in my opinion, learning how to cook well isn't just about making delicious dishes - it's also about eating healthier meals made with fresh ingredients 'cause I will know exactly what ingredients I'm using and how much of each one. Plus, it can save me quite a bit of money 'cause home-cooked meals can be a lot cheaper than buying food at restaurants or getting take out. ",

What's more, <u>it lets me save money</u> as I have a choice about where and how many products to buy.

One more reason why I cook for everyone is the fact that <u>I have enough time for that</u>.

            "Would you use mirrors to decorate your room?<br><arrow>Well, I think I would as <u>they would add character and a touch of elegance to it</u>. Also, <u>mirrors would add light and depth</u> to my room, which would <u>visually enlarge the space and make the room look brighter</u>. All things considered, mirrors would <u>make my room look better in general</u>, so it would be a good idea to buy a few mirrors in the near future to make the room more inviting.",
            "Do you usually take a mirror with you?<br><arrow>Oh yeah, I always take a purse mirror with me because <u>it doesn't take up much space</u>, <u>it's small and light-weight</u>, but it <u>helps me feel more confident during those precious moments I want to look and feel my best</u>. What's more, <u>it lets me take a quick glance at myself to check my hair and makeup as often as I want regardless of where I am</u>. So, <u>it definitely brings convenience to my daily life</u> and takes its rightful place in my handbag.",
            "How often do you use a mirror?<br><arrow>Oh, I use a mirror <u>almost every other minute</u>. For instance, one of the first things I do in the morning is look in the mirror. It is not because I enjoy looking at myself. It is just simply unavoidable. I go to the bathroom, I look up, and there I am. So <u>I always look in a mirror while brushing my teeth, washing my face and brushing my hair</u>. <u>I also use it while I'm driving</u> to see what's happening around my car.  <u>I also look at myself while I'm working out in the gym</u> to make sure I do exercises correctly. <u>It's also unavoidable when I'm in a locker room</u> at a sports centre. Actually, I always give a quick glance in a mirror if there's one nearby. ",
            "Do you use a mirror before buying a clothing?<br><arrow>Well, frankly speaking, <u>there's no point using changing room mirrors as most of them lie</u>. For example, <u>they take a dress size off you</u>. <u>They make you look taller and thinner than you are</u>. So you look at yourself and think you've found the perfect dress as it looks fabulous. Then you get home and look in your own mirror and discover it's actually a disaster. ",
            "What functions does a mirror have?<br><arrow>I believe its main function is <u>to let you compare what you look like to what you think you should look like and make appropriate changes if necessary</u>. For example, <u>you may give a quick glance in the mirror to check your hair and makeup, especially during those precious moments when you want to look and feel your best</u>. Also, <u>some mirrors can really enhance decor and make a room brighter and bigger-looking</u>. Oh, I nearly forgot to say that <u>mirrors are vital for safe driving as they allow you to observe what is happening around your car</u>. And <u>it's really important to use side mirrors and a rear view one before you start to speed up, slow down, change direction, turn or stop</u>. ",
            "Have you ever bought a mirror?<br><arrow>Sure. <u>I bought a full length mirror to place on the floor in the entrance hall to look at myself from head to toe before I leave home to make sure I look good</u>. <u>I bought one more mirror to hang on the wall in the bathroom so that I could look at myself while brushing my teeth or doing my hair</u>. And, of course, <u>I bought several compact mirrors while travelling abroad as they make wonderful gifts</u>. "

This model had <u>a finger recognition system</u>, so in most cases I used touch ID to activate different apps and services, which was a wonderful feature for lazy people like me.

Plus, they are better for the environment 'cause they use energy-efficient building materials that, by the way, make modern houses cheaper to keep heated or cooled. Due to this, they are less expensive to maintain, which is no less important than being eco-friendly. Another reason why I prefer living in modern houses is that they are more practical 'cause modern house plans utilize space more efficiently. There is almost no transitional space. And everything feels more connected. Finally, I can't help mentioning one more important thing: modern houses tend to already have modern conveniences, whereas old houses often lack ductwork or central air systems because those technologies simply did not yet exist when they were built.",
            "Are there any old buildings you want to see in the future?<br><arrow>Definitely. The first must-visit on my travel bucket list is a visit to the iconic Taj Mahal. I've seen the Taj Mahal in movies and in magazines. I've read articles about it. To my mind, it's one of the most elegant and impressive pieces of architecture ever built. Plus, it's one of the seven wonders of the world. So I really want to see it with my own eyes. Of course, it's not the only old building that I'd like to see before I die. The list is quite long, actually.",
            "Should old buildings be preserved?<br><arrow>I guess 'yes', especially <u>if they are a symbol of architectural heritage</u>. Such buildings usually <u>create a lasting imprint on the area they are in and  provide an insight into the history of the country</u>. This draws attention to the country and <u>provides important income attracting great numbers of tourists</u>.",
            "What aspect of culture do old buildings reflect?<br><arrow>I'd say that both old and new buildings reflect three most important aspects of culture. The first is <u>the type of behavior of the people of the time</u>, for example, <u>the speed of their life</u> reflected in construction materials they used and design of the buildings. The second is <u>the art of the time</u>. I mean <u>a variety of forms</u> common to a particular historical period  or <u>the techniques builders of the time used</u>. And the third aspect is <u>religion</u>, that is beliefs people had and reflected in the buildings they constructed.",
            "How do old buildings affect the appearance of a place?<br><arrow>Well, <u>they add some inexplicable charm to the area creating an attractive and mixed environment and making the place distinctive</u>. What is more, <u>they create the context</u> defining the style of the buildings around and completing the skyline in accordance with them."

The rarer the stamp, the more valuable it is, and collectors might even travel far and wide in the search of highly-prized stamps. For example, 'Russian Warship, go... !' has become the most wanted stamp not only in my country, but in many countries all over the world. It was sold on Ebay for 1500 dollars. Classic cars, art, coins, NFTs and celebrity memorabilia are also popular collectible items with a high potential return on investment. I should say collecting cars isn't an option for everybody, but they are considered one of the coolest things to have. Children of all ages collect stickers, coins, badges, squishies, Happy Meal toys, Lego sets.",
            "Is collecting a popular pastime in your country?<br><arrow>Well, it certainly is. And I guess the main reason why it is so popular is simple: <u>it's fun</u>! I mean <u>people find pleasure in searching for items to add to their collection</u>. I think what they enjoy the most is <u>the challenge of finding the items</u>. Also, <u>people enjoy collecting different things and grouping them in different ways</u>. <u>Some people who experience stress may use collecting as a form of escape</u>. Others collect things <u>in order to be part of their peer group</u>. And I can't help mentioning one more reason - <u>this comes from an instinct</u>. <u>Our ancestors learned skills of hunting and gathering supplies they needed for survival</u>.",
            "What are the benefits of collecting?<br><arrow>Well, collecting things is a wonderful hobby which can help to expand people's mind, improve their mental capacity, and boost their mental health and overall wellbeing. The most important benefits it brings are the following. First of all, <u>it builds a desire for knowledge because it's natural for collectors to want to know as much about their specialist subject as possible</u>. Secondly, <u>it inspires creativity as the more people experience, the more ideas and views they can pull from when trying to come up with something new</u>. Also, <u>it improves organizational thinking due to the need to sort and categorize the objects in collections</u>, and <u>builds observational skills as collectors are always on the lookout for new and rare objects that they can add to their collection which makes them much more mindful of the world around them</u>. And, of course, <u>it promotes relaxation and stress reduction as collecting provides a safe space where collectors can abandon their worries and just feel happy</u>.",

What's more, <u>it satisfies my natural hunting instinct and lets me enjoy the social interaction with fellow collectors</u>. So, yeah, I do collect things, but I'm not a crazy collector. I don't spend all my money and free time on building out a collection."

I really love them and can't imagine my life without communication with them.",

It's also important for me to choose friends among <u>trustworthy</u> people to be sure <u>I can always rely on them and tell them all my secrets</u>. That's it!",

I also like to stay on my own when I need <u>to engage in deep thought, improve concentration and increase productivity</u>.

For example, young kids, as I've noticed many times, <u>possess a strong and consistent willingness to share their toys with their peers</u>, maybe because <u>they have a strong tendency to cooperate</u>. As for older kids, I wouldn't say that <u>they have a reflexive desire to share</u> but <u>they willingly cooperate with others when their parents and teachers offer positive reinforcement every time kids share something important for them with others</u>.

It was a much-needed break from the stresses of work, and I came back feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.",

There are also cases when I just need <u>to meet my friends or spend time with beloved ones</u> to relax. Very seldom I opt for such rest as <u>working out in the gym, dancing or going shopping</u>.

            "Is there anything that has made you feel happy lately?<br><arrow>Yeah, lots of things, actually. Recently, I've realized that happiness can come from very simple things that we all experience every day but often ignore. I mean things like spending time with friends, enjoying a nice meal, going for a walk in the park, or finishing a small task <u>I’d been putting off</u>. I've started really appreciating these things, and I feel happy every day.<br>",

I want to continue learning new skills and gaining new knowledge, and feel a sense of accomplishment from my progress. And one more important thing for my future happiness is <u>building strong relationships with family and friends</u> as I have no doubt that spending quality time with loved ones and making memories together will bring a lot of joy and fulfillment to my life.",

And of course, it's a great boost to my confidence and happiness at work <u>when I receive recognition for my efforts and hard work</u>.",

Sure, they may provide temporary pleasure, but true happiness comes from within. It's about having a sense of purpose, strong relationships, and inner peace. Material things are fleeting and will never bring the long-term satisfaction and fulfillment that comes from living a meaningful life.",

Another thing that made me happy when I was a kid was <u>doing different experiments which let me learn how things work, how they look inside and how they are made</u>. Oh, and the last thing that made me happy was <u>receiving presents I wanted</u>. Yeah, I must admit that gifts make me happy even these days."
