                    "text": "<arrow>I'm sure a rare example of someone with seemingly boundless energy is my grandfather. It seems his motto is, \"Life's too short to be idle.\" <p>Now in his late 70s and retired, he could sleep late, spend more time in bed, read books, or watch TV. But instead, he's always on the go, despite his age. He wakes up with the sun and starts his day with morning exercises outdoors, regardless of the weather or season. Then he gets to work on chores like washing and cleaning. Since my grandmother passed away 20 years ago, he's done all the housework himself. He also works in the yard, the orchard, and his vegetable garden. Yet, he never seems to feel tired. At least, he never says he's tired. In fact, the more he does, the more energized he seems to get. It's incredible. I'm just 30, and I'm nowhere near as active as him. At the end of the day, I can't wait to get home and collapse on the couch. My grandfather, on the other hand, is always up for an evening stroll. I rely on extra-large coffees to get through the day, but he never relies on caffeine. He believes the most powerful source of energy comes from within. </p><p>When people ask him how he stays so energized, he always says there are three keys to living a vibrant life. First, he says his energy levels are directly tied to how refreshed he feels each morning. He never sacrifices sleep, especially for TV, and he eats well. Second, he surrounds himself with the right people - those who are passionate about life, knowledge, and work - and avoids people who constantly complain. Finally, he believes in doing something meaningful with his time. He spreads enthusiasm to everyone around him, and his energy is infectious. I can't help admiring him and wish there were more people like him."

But I'm sure that he did exactly what he was born to do, and he wouldn't have changed his job for all the world. For him, it wasn't just a job, it was his calling. <p> My grandfather's work occupied all his time. He never had a second job. It was just impossible as he had no time for that. If he had had a second job, he would have died of fatigue. Sometimes I doubted my grandfather was a human being. He didn't have hobbies. He didn't spend time with friends. He even missed most family gatherings. You know, it's not fun at all. He was always tired, and his eyes were always red because of endless sleepless nights. When he wasn't on duty, he was reading different books and reviewing medical records of his patients. </p><p>In my opinion, it is a very rewarding job. But I wouldn't like to do anything like that because it's really stressful, especially when you understand that you cannot help some patient. Plus, shift work is not my thing. I can't imagine myself working night shifts. What's more, I don't want to sacrifice everything for work. "

Last winter, <u>I had an overnight bus journey from Big City to Cool City</u>. <p>When I found out I needed to make this trip, train tickets were already sold out, and buying a plane ticket was out of the question. It was way too expensive. So, taking the bus was my only option at the time.</p><p>I hate travelling long distances by bus, especially at night, mostly because I can't sleep sitting up. This was exactly the case. Since I couldn't sleep, I stared out of the window. It was almost dawn, so I could barely see anything, but it was still better than staring at the back of the seat in front of me. </p><p>Suddenly I heard a dull thud, and a few minutes later, the bus stopped. The driver got off to check, but he didn’t come back for half an hour. </p><p>At first, everything seemed ok. All the passengers were sleeping and had no idea something was wrong. If I had been able to sleep, I probably wouldn’t have noticed anything either. But unfortunately, I wasn’t as lucky as the others. </p><p>Several hours later everyone woke up and realized that we were stuck in the middle of nowhere. The worst part? There was no toilet - not even trees or bushes in sight. Just an endless field. For people like me, who are used to modern conveniences, it was a nightmare.</p><p><u>As time went on, people grew angrier by the hour. Some passengers even lost their temper and started yelling at the driver, even though it wasn’t his fault. He was doing everything he could to fix the problem, but it wasn’t easy. </p><p><u>We ended up spending five or six hours on the side of the highway before we could finally continue the journey.</u>.

My grandpa even said he was more afraid to die of loneliness than of coronavirus. So since the pandemic, I’ve been visiting them more often to make up for the time we lost even though it takes me 5 hours to get there. <p>My grandparents live in a quiet and beautiful place by the river. They have a cozy house with a big garden. There are lots of flowers, and sometimes orchids bloom too. You know, being there is like travelling back in time. Everything reminds me of my carefree childhood: my toys, old CDs, my bicycle. It feels like you step into another world. All the walls are still covered with old wallpaper. My grandmother doesn’t allow us to remove it, and she refuses to get their house refurbished because she wants to keep all their memories alive. She says they both love their 50-year-old chairs and armchairs, their old wooden table in the kitchen, paintings, clay pots, old pictures, and lots of things they bought when they were young. </p><p>You know, I think she’s right. There’s something special about this old house. It’s a magical place, and I really love spending time there. When I visit, I enjoy going fishing and exploring the countryside during the day. In the evenings, I watch the sunset from the backyard. I drink hot tea and eat cinnamon buns. My grandmother always bakes them when I come because she knows how much I love them. If I didn't have so much on my plate and if the trip didn't take so long, I would visit them more often."

Before, I used to wake up already feeling tired, like I’d been carrying heavy loads all night. I’d feel drained all day long. I used to drink three cups of coffee just to function. And even that didn’t always help. I have no idea how it works, but now I feel full of energy. </p><p>This change has made me so much more productive, both at work and at home. Plus, I finally have time for myself. In the mornings, while everyone else is still asleep, I read, do yoga, meditate, and plan my day.

They looked amazing and felt fine. I couldn’t wait to wear them out. So I decided to take them for a walk the very next day. <p>When I started walking, I felt something was off, but at that point, I couldn't figure out what exactly was wrong. The next day, I gave them another shot. I was hoping they’d get better with time. But they didn’t. This time, it hurt everywhere, and my left foot was literally one big blister. The sneakers were beautiful and high-quality, but I knew I’d never wear them again. So I had no choice but to return them. </p><p>Thank God, the store had a simple return policy. I just filled out a form online, packed the sneakers back into the box, and dropped them off at the nearest courier service. Within a week, I got my refund."

But it's super important for keeping things running smoothly. I mean we work in a busy office where we have to coordinate a lot of tasks and projects. If someone is late, it can mess up the whole schedule. Meetings get delayed, deadlines get pushed back, and it can be a real headache for everyone. So if it weren't for this rule, we would have a really hard time getting work done. Literally. <p>So, I totally get why this rule is in place, and I actually think it's a good one. It helps us stay organized and make sure we're all on the same page. Plus, it shows respect for our colleagues and the company because we're valuing everyone's time. </p><p>But here's the thing: not everyone followed this rule. There were a few coworkers who were constantly late, and it was frustrating. It was not fair to the rest of us who made an effort to be on time, and it often created tension in the office. </p><p>Now, if someone does break this rule and is late without a good reason, there are consequences. Usually, our boss will have a chat with them and remind them of the importance of being punctual. If it keeps happening, they might get a formal warning. And if it continues after that, well, they could even lose their job. </p><p>So, while the rule about being on time might seem strict, I think it's necessary to keep things running smoothly and maintain a respectful work environment. And personally, I'm all for it because it makes my workday a lot less stressful."

                {
                    "text": "<arrow>In my school, there's this really long list of rules we have to follow. Most of them are there to make sure the school is safe and orderly and that we students behave ourselves. But some of these rules are just way too strict. Like, <u>we have to wear a uniform</u>. Girls wear a shirt, a knee-length woolen skirt, socks or tights, and shoes. Boys wear a shirt and trousers. And we can only buy our uniforms from one specific place to make sure we all look exactly the same. No other options are allowed. Then there's the whole thing about how we look. Piercings are not allowed. No jewelry, no makeup, and we can't even have our hair dyed. If you have long hair, it has to be tied back all the time.<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I get that wearing a uniform is practical and it helps keep distractions in check. When everyone dresses the same way, it's easier to focus on schoolwork instead of what people are wearing. And no one gets teased for not following fashion trends, which is nice.</p><p>But honestly, at my school, these rules are just over the top. I mean, I get it if we came to school in ripped jeans, that's not cool. But why the heck should plain blue jeans with no fancy stuff be a problem. Shirts have to be tucked in, which is fine. It makes us look neat. But if your socks aren't pulled up or your shoes' heel straps aren't perfect, you can be sent home or given a talking to.  And if you dare to wear even tiny earrings, they make you take them out. You can't even go back to class until your parents meet with the principal or teacher. That's insane. And for the boys, if they wear the wrong kind of shoes or trousers, they can get detention or even suspended for one to ten days. Thank God, we don't have physical punishment. </p><p>Honestly, without the uniform policy, I think we'd be showing up in all sort of outfits like sweaters, short skirts, hoodies, you name it. Most of us would probably have tattoos and piercings galore. It'd be a total mess. But the extreme rules we have in our school aren't much better."

But I knew that I had to do whatever it takes to protect my children. </p><p>We hastily packed our bags and made our way to the train station, hoping to catch the last train out of the city. The scene at the station was chaotic - there were crowds of people pushing and shoving, everyone trying to board the same train. Children were crying, their parents trying to calm them down. People were shouting and screaming, desperate to get out of the city before it was too late. As we finally managed to board the train, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief mixed with uncertainty and guilt. The train journey was long and uncomfortable, but we finally reached the border and crossed into a neighboring country. We were lucky enough to have some friends who took us in and helped us settle down.</p><p>As time passed, I realized that I had made the right decision. Several months after we left, our city was hit by a massive missile attack and our house was destroyed.  Looking back on that difficult decision to flee the country, I am grateful for the safety and security we found in a new place. It wasn't an easy journey, but it was necessary to protect my kids and start a new life."

At first, I was excited about the job, but after a few months, I started feeling like I was stuck in a rut. I was doing the same tasks every day, and there were no opportunities for me to grow professionally or be promoted within the company. <p>I tried talking to my supervisor about my concerns, but he didn't seem to take them seriously. He told me that I was doing a great job and that I should just keep doing what I was doing. But that didn't satisfy me. I felt like I was wasting my potential and my career was at a standstill. </p><p>I started looking for other job opportunities, but it was a difficult process. The job market in my field was competitive, and most of the available positions required several years of experience that I didn't have. However, I didn't give up. I continued to search and apply for jobs, and eventually, I received an offer from a smaller company. </p><p>Even though the new job had a lower salary than my previous position, it offered me the opportunity to take on more responsibility and grow professionally. I knew that it was a risk to leave a stable job for a new opportunity, but I decided to take the chance. </p><p><u>Quitting my old job was a difficult decision, and I was nervous about the future</u>. But looking back, I know it was the right decision. The new company has given me the chance to learn new skills and take on more challenging projects.

Once my parents and I were having dinner, when suddenly they told me it was time to start thinking about my future and... (this is where the nightmare began) that they were ready to pay for my education abroad if it was what I really wanted to do. At first, I was on cloud nine, but then I started agonizing over the decision.<p>You can't even imagine how painful the process was. I asked my friends what they would do if they were given such an opportunity. Needless to say, opinions differed wildly. Then I made a list of  pros and cons and analyzed all 'what-ifs' which threw me into doubt all the time. I also read a few articles about education abroad and found out what other students were saying about their experience. I even tried to consider job prospects in different countries.</p><p>I struggled to make a decision because my future was at stake. And, of course, I was afraid to suffer consequences of the wrong choice. It was difficult to imagine what living abroad would be like (taking into account the current situation regarding covid-19). Also, I knew I would have to start my life from the very beginning. And to top it off, I realised I would have to leave my friends and family behind.</p><p>After a great deal of thought I decided to seize this opportunity as it's better to regret what you have done than what you haven't. Now I'm planning to study in Canada.  Of course, the outcomes cannot be accurately predicted yet, but I hope I made the right decision. We'll see. I'm still worried and fear disappointment but at the same time I'm looking forward to this change."

Since I absolutely love traveling, I always include a list of countries I'd like to visit. Like every year, I decided to write down a list of travel destinations.<p>I started surfing the internet, reading travel blogs, and watching videos on YouTube. One of the countries I came across was Cuba. I saw lots of pictures of its remarkable mountains, spectacular limestone hills, vast tobacco plantations, butter-soft beaches, lush green countryside, and colorful colonial cities. At some point, I realized there was something about Cuba that made me put it at the very top of my travel wish list.</p><p>Many travellers say that it's a truly unique place. The thing is, the country was isolated from the rest of the world for many years. And despite the fact that most restrictions were lifted some years ago, it hasn't changed a lot since then. Everyone says it seems to be lost in time, somewhere in the 1950's. I mean, people usually describe it as a place with salsa and rumba music playing everywhere, men smoking cigars and drinking rum, old American cars in the streets, and the beautiful colonial buildings with peeling paint in Old Havana. For me, it's really hard to believe that anything like that is possible in our modern world. So I want to experience it for myself. </p><p>At the moment, I don't know more than that, and I'm not planning to continue my research 'cause if I learn everything before visiting, there will be nothing left to discover when I go there one day. It won't be interesting. I know myself. So I really want to know more about this country, but I don't want to explore it from my couch."

But my excitement faded really quickly ‘cause <u>I underestimated what this would take</u>. I mean having a dog is like having a baby. You just can't wake up early to walk the dog one day, and then sleep in the next day. You have to walk the dog twice a day no matter how tired you are, and no matter what you're up to today.

Later, you'll understand why. <p>She played some of her favorite songs, and one of them was 'Wannabe' by the Spice Girls. I kind of liked it and decided to listen to it one more time. On the one hand, almost all the words were clear; however, I wasn't able to sing along. The only line I could sing along to was: \"So tell me what you want, what you really, really want.\" To be honest, even now, I don't remember more than that. </p><p>Back then, I took it as a challenge. I found the lyrics and tried to read the first verse quickly. Then I attempted to sing along again. Although I could read the lyrics fast, I ran out of breath while trying to keep up with the vocalist. Every time, I ended up slurring my words like a drunk. </p><p>I decided not to give up. I told myself, 'Impossible is nothing.' I played the song over and over until I got tired of it. However, all my attempts to sing along with the first verse failed. Later, I realized I had made a fatal mistake by listening to that song on repeat. </p><p>The next day, I woke up with 'Wannabe' stuck in my head. I kept repeating those few lines from the verse over and over in my mind. I tried listening to other songs, but as soon as one song finished, 'Wannabe' would return, stuck on a loop in my head. I thought I was going to go crazy. </p><p>I must say, it's one of the most persistent earworms ever. Once it buries itself in your brain, it feels like you'd need surgery to remove it once and for all. Out of curiosity, I decided to google more about this girl group. What I found shocked me a little. This song is actually at the top of the list of the catchiest songs of all time. If only I had known that earlier."

My throat felt scratchy, and I sneezed a few times, but I thought, ‘Oh, it’s nothing. I’ll be fine tomorrow.’ <p><p>However, when I woke up on Saturday morning, I felt terrible. My head was heavy, my nose wouldn’t stop running, and I had a terrible cough. I checked my temperature, and it was higher than normal. I knew right away I couldn’t go to the party like this. </p><p>I felt so disappointed. I was really looking forward to seeing my friends, eating cake, and celebrating together. But I also didn’t want to ruin the party by coughing everywhere or making someone else sick. I texted my friend and told her I couldn’t come. <p><p>So instead of going out, I spent the day at home. I stayed in my pajamas, drank hot tea with honey, and watched a few old movies. My mom even made me some chicken soup, which was really comforting. Even though I missed the party, I knew it was the right decision to stay home and rest. "

You know, just one sweater took up half the space. So I decided to borrow a bigger one ‘cause I didn't want to buy an item that I would use once in a blue moon. I have a friend from work who is a serial traveller, and he has suitcases of all sizes and shapes. So I decided to borrow a suitcase from him. <p>The one that he gave to me was hardside luggage. This made me a little worried. These suitcases are very stylish, but prone to cracking and damage. And they are particularly vulnerable to damage during carriage on an airplane while being loaded and unloaded. They do not like being thrown around as many baggage handlers do. I was really afraid it would be scratched or damaged in any other way.</p><p>What I feared came upon me. My luggage was damaged during the flight. I didn't know how to tell my friend about it. I decided to buy exactly the same suitcase and return it to my friend, hoping he wouldn't notice the change. </p><p>I spent a few days searching for it, but this suitcase model was out of stock. So all I could do was tell my friend the truth about his suitcase and offer a replacement item. </p><p>When I told him the news, he was so upset that he didn't even manage to get the right look on his face. It appeared to be his favourite suitcase. But he wasn't angry with me ‘cause it wasn't my fault."

So I know what I'm talking about. I mean I have enough evidence to prove that she's an open person. Oh no, to say ‘open' is to say nothing. I think she's too open about her feelings. <p>If something is on her mind, she always lets people know about it whether they want it or not. For example, she tells people when something is bothering her, when something makes her feel excited, depressed or uncomfortable. She isn't afraid to tell people about painful or embarrassing situations that she experienced. And I know that she always says what she means, but not what other people want to hear. What's more, she posts a lot of personal details on Facebook and Instagram. I always joke that if we stopped being friends, I would still know as much information about her feelings and opinions as I do being her best friend and communicating with her every day. </p><p>On the one hand, I admire her ability to open up even to strangers ‘cause this helps her connect a lot more with other people. Her openness encourages other people to open up, and this helps to create a more open and trusting environment. Also, Ann is very easy to deal with, and it doesn't take much time to get to know her. When she is offended, she shows it and says that she's offended and explains why. When she's angry or embarrassed, she doesn't hide her emotions as well. Dealing with her doesn't require guesswork to understand what her opinion about something is, whether she's happy or not and why. You know, I find it really stressful and annoying to deal with people who have a blank and emotionless expression on their faces at all times.  I can't read anyone's mind. And I don't want to. </p><p>On the other hand, I don't think it's good to be an open book all the time. I always tell her that she should be selective about who she tells about herself. First of all, it can be dangerous for her. And this makes her vulnerable. Also, I think she discloses too much too soon. This turns some people off. I'm sure it would be much better if she kept self-disclosure to conversations with close people. And it seems to me her being too open is the main reason why she's still single. This drives some guys away and makes them lose interest. And I have to say that her openness isn't always appropriate. I mean that by expressing what she is feeling, she not only passes some of her emotion to others, but she also has to be ready to deal with the aftermath of that disclosure. But she isn't. "

I've been using it a lot since I decided to adopt a cat.\n<p>Several years ago, I saw a kitten sitting alone in the street, shivering in the rain. My heart melted, so I brought it home. I just couldn't leave it there. But my family wasn’t as excited as I was because they knew this meant more housework. I had always tried to avoid helping around the house, and they worried that cat hair would be everywhere. So, I had to promise to vacuum the floors, furniture, and carpets at least three times a week if I wanted to keep the kitten. </p><p>They even took pity on me and bought a vacuum cleaner specially designed for pet owners. It's a canister model, with the motor and dust collector connected to the vacuum head by a flexible hose. It’s a wheeled type and has really strong suction power, so cleaning doesn’t take much effort. It’s also compact and lightweight, making it easy to use. </p><p>I'm still keeping my promise, so I regularly vacuum all surfaces, using different attachments for different tasks. If it weren’t for this vacuum cleaner, the whole flat would be covered in cat hair because my tiny kitten grew into a very fluffy cat. </p><p>I’m really grateful that humanity invented this household device because it saves me a lot of time and lets me clean the whole flat quickly."

It premiered in 2011, on HBO, but I watched it only last month. By the way, this was the first time I had watched an entire series in one sitting.<p>The events take place on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos in a setting that very much resembles the Middle Ages. The main idea is that several noble families fight for control over the mythical lands of Westeros. These families are the Starks of Winterfell, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, and the Baratheons of Dragonstone. To tell the truth, it's very difficult to say who the main character is as whenever one seems to be taking the lead, they are killed off. </p><p>What I really like is that this TV series has a really compelling plot, and I was always on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. Also, it's really thought-provoking and shows life as it is. First of all, it contains a lot of violent scenes, and this is what reminds me that our life is not a bed of roses, but a constant struggle. Secondly, it shows that there are countless ways to reach the same goal. All the heroes strive for the same thing, but use absolutely different strategies to achieve the desired result. Another thing that I like is that it is dynamic and not excessively long. There are just 10 episodes in each of the six seasons. </p><p>I'm sure this TV series is worth a few hours of your time if you haven't watched it yet."

But after I had completed a 5000-piece gradient puzzle, I lost interest in this activity. Since then I've been given lots of them, but they are still unopened, collecting dust on some shelf. <p>The only puzzle that I have completed since childhood was <u>a 3D wooden mechanical pendulum clock puzzle</u> that my friend gave me for my birthday last year. I was really excited ‘cause it was something new for me. And I was hoping it would be challenging as well. </p><p>I thought it would take me a while to assemble it, but it took me a minute to figure out the process. And once you have the hang of it, it's super easy and lots of fun. So I put it together, all by myself in just a few hours. There were easy to follow instructions. And needed neither glue nor scissors to put it together. The only challenge I faced was that some pieces  required a good deal of hand strength to snap together. But it was good ‘cause they snapped together perfectly, making it almost impossible to break apart once its assembled. </p><p>So even though it wasn't extremely challenging, I enjoyed solving it ‘cause doing jigsaw puzzles is a really good way to unwind after a hard working day and spend quality time on your own.

She's of the few people who really care about the environment.Of course, she doesn't do things on a large scale. But even the small things she does make a real difference in our city. <p>She thinks each of us can (and should) take initiative to change what we feel is wrong in our society, neighbourhood, or workplace. For example, recently she declared war on paper waste in our office. My colleagues used to waste a lot of paper. They used to print anything and everything, so there were unused copies all over the place. To be honest, I was guilty of this too and often made copies I didn’t need at all. </p><p>One day, she gathered all the employees and talked to us about paper waste. I was blown away to learn that it takes an average of five liters of water to produce a single A4 sheet. She also spoke about the depletion of natural resources, paper pollution, and other serious consequences of mindless paper use. Then, she put up posters with these eye-opening facts all around the office to encourage people to switch to electronic documents whenever possible and to think twice before printing anything. And it worked for us. </p><p>Beyond the office, she also helps protect the environment by organizing community cleanups in her neighborhood, and I know that many people support her efforts. </p><p>I really admire her because I think her contribution is invaluable. I wish there were more people like her. I mean people who understand that we shape society, so it’s up to us to make it better."

My dad explained the basic rules, like how to dribble, pass, and shoot, but after that, it was mostly me practicing on my own. I remember spending hours outside, trying to make the perfect shot. I also watched NBA games from time to time, and I’d try to copy moves from the players. <p>These days, I don’t play as often as I’d like to because I have so much on my plate with work and other responsibilities. But whenever I do get the chance, I really enjoy it. You're running, jumping, and always moving, so it’s a great workout. At the same time, it never feels like just exercise because you’re focused on the game. And it’s fun. </p><p>Another reason I love basketball is that it’s a great way to compete and spend time with friends. I’m a pretty competitive person, so I enjoy challenging myself and trying to win. But even when I lose, it’s still a good time. Playing with friends makes it even better because we get to joke around and have fun while playing. </p><p>So yeah, basketball is definitely my favorite sport. I just wish I had more time to play. "

An incredible performance is about to start!' It was a live broadcast, so I decided to tune in, thinking I’d just take a short break from work. <p>At first, there were just two acro dancers moving gracefully across the stage. For the first 30 seconds, nothing extraordinary happened. I was hugely disappointed and was about to close the video when, suddenly, one of the girls did a handstand and landed in a bridge with one leg up. Her toes were perfectly pointed, and her leg was as straight as an arrow. And that’s when the magic began. </p><p>The other girl, the top partner, quickly mounted her and did a handstand on top of her foot. I gasped in amazement. You should have seen the judges. They were staring at the girls, open-mouthed. Then, the base girl started lifting her other leg up to about 45 degrees. I couldn’t believe my eyes. What I saw completely defied the laws of physics. </p><p>They kept going with more mind-blowing double tricks, insane partner handstands, and other gravity-defying acrobatic moves. One of the judges kept repeating, 'How is this even possible?' while the others watched in wide-eyed amazement. The performance was so incredible that I couldn't take my eyes off the stage. And I couldn’t help but watch it again and again. I was completely blown away. </p><p> To be honest, it's hard to put this experience into words - other than OMG, OMG, OMG! I was so impressed that I even posted about it on my Facebook timeline, which is something I almost never do."

It came into effect just a few years ago, which is pretty recent for a law. <p>I think this ban is one of the smartest laws ever passed. You know, if someone chooses to damage their health, that’s their right. I’m fine with that. But it's not fair for non-smokers to inhale tobacco smoke against their will just because smokers feel like lighting up wherever they please. So I’m happy that this ban keeps non-smokers away from secondhand smoke, which prevents a range of health issues like respiratory diseases, nausea, and headaches. It has also helped discourage smoking in general. Kids tend to copy what they see adults doing, so the less they see people smoking in public, the lower the chances they’ll pick up the habit themselves. </p><p>All in all, it’s a law that has done a lot of good. But I would take this law even further. I believe there should be stricter fines for littering cigarette butts, since many smokers still toss them on the ground without a second thought. Cigarette butts are non-biodegradable, and they pollute the soil, clog water systems, and leach dangerous chemicals into the environment. If the government really wants to tackle smoking-related problems, they should address this issue as well. "

He is one of the greatest players of all time. Football experts compare him to the legendary Maradona. And I'm talking about <u>Lionel Messi</u>. He started making headlines many years ago, and he's still very popular. <p>Messi was born in a small town in Argentina. He was just 5 when he started playing football. When he was a teenager, agents from Barcelona saw his talent, and he moved to Spain. He became one of the youngest players in Barcelona. By the way, in 2021, he announced that he was leaving Barcelona after 21 years of playing for the club (the only club he had played for at that time) 'cause the club said it could no longer afford to pay. It was very emotional, and I even started crying when I saw him crying at his farewell press conference. After that, he played for Paris Saint-Germain for two seasons, and now he plays for Inter Miami in the USA. <p></p>He has had a lot of extraordinary achievements and won a lot of trophies so far. For example, in 2022, he won the World Cup with Argentina and was named the best player of the tournament. He also won multiple European Champions League titles and the World Club Championship with Barcelona. What's more, he's Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer. </p><p>I love to watch him playing, especially when he scores his beautiful goals from quick counterattacks. He is undoubtedly a natural talent. You know, the ball seems to be glued to his foot. He is a master at reading the game, and he's very quick. Everyone calls him the greatest dribbler of his generation. I particularly like when he dribbles at high speed, then he suddenly slows down, waits for the defender to get closer to him, then accelerates in the opposite direction. It doesn't matter how many defenders try to stop him, it's simply impossible. What's interesting is that everyone knows this trick, but he does it again and again, and defenders always go for that. I can't help admiring Messi because he does things that people talk about years later."

But last Friday, I came home from work, collapsed on the sofa, and passed out. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I realized I needed a full day of doing nothing to reboot my system. I was on the verge of burnout. So, I decided to visit a spa center. <p>I went alone because I didn’t want to talk to anyone. If I had invited my friends, I would have had to engage in conversations, which would have drained all my energy. So, I kept my plan to myself. </p><p>I spent some time in a steam room, then moved to a sauna with dry herbal steam. I swam in a pool and even stepped into a snow room once. Between sauna sessions, I sipped herbal tea. </p><p>But what I enjoyed the most was the Japanese bath. There were two hot tubs (one at 45C and the other at 40C) plus a swimming pool with water at 6-8C. First, I sat in the hotter tub for about three minutes, then moved to the second one. After that, I plunged into the cold water before returning to the hot tub. I repeated this cycle several times. By the end, I felt like I was born again.    "

He promised that we would spend the whole day outside the following weekend. And we did. <p>My husband suggested going for a bike ride through the countryside. I agreed, even though I hadn’t ridden a bicycle since childhood. So, we rented two bikes, which didn’t cost much, and set off for our country house, which is in a beautiful area near a coniferous forest. Funnily enough, we had only ever had barbecue parties in the garden there and had never really explored the nature around us. </p><p>We took some food because we weren’t sure if we would be back quickly or spend the whole day cycling. We also brought a navigator to avoid getting lost in the middle of nowhere. At first, I rode at a snail’s pace, focusing entirely on balancing and steering. Of course, that meant I couldn’t really appreciate the scenery. But it was fun. It felt a bit like being a kid again. </p><p>Soon, I got the hang of it and started riding confidently. We passed cows grazing in green fields, ducks hiding in the grass, and beautiful wildflowers with butterflies fluttering around them. We often stopped to take photos and soak in the stunning views. Overall, it wasn’t a strenuous ride. Whenever we felt tired, we simply wheeled our bikes along.</p><p>By evening, we returned to our starting point and headed home. We were physically tired, but it helped me recharge my batteries, and it was fun."

On the other, I was a bit afraid.

Although they were expensive, I thought there wouldn't be a better chance in the near future, so I was determined to taste them come what may.</p><p>My friends started eating, saying every other second how <u>delicious</u> they were. I plucked up my courage, took the first oyster and slurped it before I changed my mind.</p><p>When my mouth was filled with slime, I had to swallow this slippery liquid just because there were many people around. But <u>if I had been at home, I would have spitted it out immediately as the texture was just horrible</u>. </p><p>A few minutes later I thought, okay, one more try. I grabbed another one, not expecting much, but somehow, it actually tasted good. Then I had a third. And before I knew it, I’d basically eaten the whole plate.

You stand on a board which is connected to a watercraft by means of a very long hose. The watercraft gives the flyboard propulsion, so you can move underwater and fly over the water.<p>First, I saw a video on Facebook which really impressed me. Then I was on holiday <u>last summer</u> and my friend suggested trying this activity. </p><p>Of course, I agreed without hesitation, but later understood that I wasn't a suitable candidate for this activity. So I refused. The main reason is that <u>I didn't want to get injured and spend several months in hospital just because I wanted to jump out of water like a dolphin for 15 minutes. And at the time <u>I wasn't fit enough</u>. This meant I wouldn't be able to control my body and movements. <u>I was afraid to damage my spine chord and break bones<u>. However, <u>my biggest fear was to have a heavy blow to the head</u>. I saw that people fell down 100 times before they were able to flyboard properly.  Also, it was quite expensive for me. It cost more than 100 dollars per 15 or 20 minutes. If I'd spent so much money, I would have spent the rest of my holiday dying of hunger.</p><p>So I refused, but my friend didn't. And It looked really impressive. On returning home, I decided to go to the gym regularly to get fitter and try flyboarding next time as <u>it's absolutely different from all the activities I've done to date</u>.</p><p>Now I'm looking forward to my next summer holidays as I'm sure <u>it's a lot of fun flying above the water like Superman, let alone the thrill of getting the adrenaline pumping through my body</u>. Also, <u>I wonder whether I will be capable of mastering it and whether it's as difficult as it seems</u>. "

We were kind of spies who broke into someone's house to find some secret files. Frankly speaking, I don't remember the storyline in detail, but I remember that we had one hour to escape the room to avoid being caught and imprisoned.</p><p>The room, in which we were locked, was packed with different stuff such as books, maps, fedoras, magnets, sticky notes, watches, old wigs, compasses, lamps, board games, playing cards. The puzzles were really challenging and intriguing. </p><p>It was real fun. We were frantically searching for clues. Some of them involved solving riddles, putting items in the correct order, or finding a set of objects hidden in the room. What I will never forget is that there was a broken clock and for a long time we couldn't figure out that we had to pay attention to the time it stopped on. By the way, it appeared to be the last clue. So we even thought we would sink with the ship, but then one us had a brainwave and we survived in the last minute.</p><p>It was really unusual an activity for all of us as <u>we hadn't done anything like that before</u>.

You stand on a board which is connected to a watercraft by means of a very long hose. The watercraft gives the flyboard propulsion, so you can move underwater and fly over the water.<p>First, I saw a video on Facebook which really impressed me. Then I was on holiday and saw people jump out of water like dolphins. It looked even more impressive. However, it was too expensive for me. It cost more than 100 dollars per 15 or 20 minutes. It's still very expensive for me, but I decided to save money for it and try it come what may as it's absolutely different from all the activities I've done to date.</p><p>I think there are only three things I'll have to think of. First of all, <u>I'll have to get in good physical shape</u>. Secondly,  <u>I'll have to rent gear such as a flyboard, wetsuit, helmet, and life jacket</u>. But it's not a problem as most training locations can provide all of this. Finally, <u>I'll have to learn some basic maneuvers and learn to operate a flyboard</u>. But people say that it only requires a short period of training to get started. So it won't be an issue either.</p><p>Now I'm looking forward to my summer holidays as I'm sure <u>it's a lot of fun flying above the water like Superman, let alone the thrill of getting the adrenaline pumping through my body</u>. Also, <u>I wonder whether I will be capable of mastering it and whether it's as difficult as it seems</u>."

So we arranged a meeting at the restaurant the next day at 6 pm. </p><p>Then on the day when we were supposed to meet, at the very last minute, he called me and said, 'Let's cancel, I can't make it. I have a fever and sore throat.' He said he had to stay in bed for a week or so. I said, 'It's ok. Get well soon'. You know, it's a normal situation. People get sick all the time. </p><p>But I had already booked a table, and it was too late to cancel a reservation. So I decided to go there anyway. When I came, I just froze, you know, 'cause I saw my friend talking to some girl. It looked like they had a date. And he obviously didn't look sick at all. What's more, he didn't look embarrassed.

But we decided to have a quick meeting to catch up. <p>Just when my friend was telling me something important, my phone started ringing. The number was unknown. On the one hand, I didn’t want to pick up the phone because I didn’t want to interrupt my friend. On the other hand, sometimes there can be emergencies when you need to call for help, and I thought it could be one of my friends or relatives. Sometimes, people might borrow someone else’s phone to make a call, so the number would be unknown. </p><p>But that wasn’t the case. It turned out to be a call from a bank. The bank worker asked if I wanted to get a credit card from them. I politely said I wasn’t interested, but she kept talking about the benefits of having one. The thing is, I’m too polite, and I find it hard to cut off people. If I were less polite, I would have ended the call in the very first minute. But the lady didn’t stop. She kept trying to keep me in the conversation, and I was getting more and more annoyed as I realized she was wasting our time. I should say I had a really hard time ending that call. </p><p>Plus, I hate talking on the phone in public places because I respect other people. When you talk to someone sitting in front of you, you can speak quietly, but when you talk on the phone, you speak louder, and that can disturb people around you."

So we used to spend a lot of time together. It was always fun ‘cause he always came up with something interesting. That's why we were never feeling bored. Also, I don't remember us having arguments frequently. <p>Then his family moved to a new neighbourhood. We were no longer neighbours, but we still studied together. Then we finished school, entered different universities, and lost touch. </p><p>When I drove past the school and remembered the good old times, I understood I really wanted to get back in touch with him. To be honest, I found it strange reaching out to him after so long. But I got up the courage and texted him. So, at first, I texted a simple ‘Hi'. Then I asked him if he was interested in getting together. He seemed to be interested in reconnecting, and we decided to catch up over coffee. On the one hand, I was looking forward to meeting him ‘cause it's always fun to remember the past. But I was a little worried that our friendship wouldn't be what it once was. </p><p>We met at a cafe. No words can really describe how happy I was to see him. First of all, I explained to him why it was that I fell out of touch. I think he appreciated knowing that it wasn't anything in particular that caused me to fall out of touch. Then we reminisced about the past. I was happy ‘cause I felt like I was reliving my carefree school days. And we promised to each other to keep in touch and arranged our next meetup."

He told us that this would be <u>a great way to get an interesting glimpse into local  culture and do shopping</u>.<p>Now I can safely say that it's by far the most crowded place I have ever visited. <u>The market was teeming with people, it was just like a bee hive</u>. <u>Shoppers from all over the world were swarming around stalls so I had to squeeze through the crowd to get a closer look at anything that was sold</u>. I couldn't even stop and look around as the crowd literally dragged me along. Vendors all vied in offering their goods to shoppers. It was really noisy.</p><p><u>I went their with my friend</u>, whom I was travelling with, but no sooner had we reached the place than we were separated by the crowd. So we quickly understood that there was no point in trying to resist in order to keep together. I just tried to look around every other minute not to lose sight of her. For this reason, <u>I can say I went there on my own</u>.</p><p>Oh, and I nearly forgot one thing. <u>I had to be very careful not to become pickpockets' victim because such crowded places are a paradise for them</u>. Therefore, on the one hand, this experience was very interesting as <u>the market's vibrant atmosphere made shopping lots of fun</u>. But <u>it was also a bit dangerous</u>. "

Although this movie is not new, I hadn't even heard about it before and watched it by pure chance. I was </u>at home</u>, the weather was bad and I didn't want to go out, so I started flipping through the channels. I saw Matt Damon on the screen and decided to watch the film just because of him. I didn't regret, and I think <u>this film was definitely worth a few hours of my time</u>.<p><u>It is a romantic science fiction thriller that depicts an affair between a politician named David and a contemporary dancer, Elise</u>. <u>David accidentally meets Elise, while rehearsing his speech</u>. <u>After they kiss each other, he gets so inspired that he delivers a great speech that makes him a favourite in the election race</u>. The only thing that makes him upset is that he doesn't even know the name of the girl. <u>One month later they meet each other on a bus</u>, but he doesn't manage to ask for her telephone number. Then <u>he takes the same bus for three years to meet her, but some mysterious forces keep them apart</u>. Later we find out that <u>this is because all the events in people's lives are controlled by the Adjustment Bureau that ensures people live according to 'the Plan' because every time humanity is granted free will, it results in wars or other negative events</u>. So <u>the bureau tries to do whatever possible to stop them from meeting each other</u>.  <u>One day David meets two men working for this bureau and they explain that they make corrections when things go slightly wrong</u>. <u>David is warned that if he doesn't stop making attempts to meet Elise, his memory will be erased</u>. <u>He decides to fight against it and tries to outsmart or elude the men in the suits and hats</u>.

Being retired, he could sleep late, but he wakes up at 5 or 6 a.m., always starting his day with morning exercises. Then he does different chores, like washing and cleaning. You know, he's been doing all housework himself since my grandmother died. Also, he works in the yard, in the orchard, and in the vegetable garden. Yet, he never feels tired. At least, he never says he's tired. It's incredible. I'm just 35, but I'm nowhere near as active as him. </p><p>There's one more thing that makes me admire him. He reads a lot every day, so it seems to me there aren't topics that wouldn't be interesting for him. </p><p>What's more, whatever happens, he looks on the bright side of life. And he has always taught me to have a positive attitude to events and people. I know that he got through a lot of challenges, but he never complains. On the contrary, he always emphasises that if it hadn't been for those hardships and if he hadn't had to work hard, he wouldn't have achieved anything in life. </p><p>Also, he is the first person I rush to when I have some dilemma. He has always given me sound advice. Somehow he manages to come up with brilliant solutions to all problems we discuss. </p><p>Sometimes we just watch TV programs together, drinking tea and reminiscing about the past. I really wish there more people like my grandfather."

So I decided to interfere, but I didn't want to put too much pressure on him, so I just said something like 'I'm here for you if you ever want to talk'. </p><p>Just as I expected it appeared that he decided to quit his job 'cause he had a conflict with a colleague. So I realised that his decision was emotional, not logical. Moreover, this meant he wanted to quit a job without another one lined up, which entails uncertainty and having no income for an indefinite period of time. So I decided to help my uncle 'cause I'm convinced that this is what family is for. And I think it's natural to want to make someone you love and care for feel better again.</p><p>I didn't tell him that he needed to calm down. Instead, I just listened to him and let him vent. About an hour later he realised he was blowing things out of proportion and that he just needed to talk to his colleague face-to-face before the conflict got out of hand."

But other people can't stand being around her for long. <p>She believes she knows best how everyone should behave and constantly offers unsolicited advice, which is really annoying to many. But what really pushes people away is that she doesn’t like listening to ideas that are different from their own. If someone disagrees with her, she says they don’t understand what they are talking about. This often makes people feel stupid after talking to her, and those who know her well just try to avoid her. So it's not surprising that she has few friends. But overall, she's a good person. If it weren't for her being so opinionated, she would definitely have many more friends. </p><p>The only time I think being opinionated helps her is in running her Instagram blog.

What I did first was <u>I read a lot of articles in magazines and consulted a dietician</u> because without professional help diets may do more harm than good. The biggest challenge was to <u>stop eating fast food</u>. I started to choose carefully what I ate, when and what for. I became a frequent visitor of a gym and <u>did exercises regularly</u>. At least 3 times per week.<p>I've been living like this for more than a year now. I have to confess that this appeared to be more difficult than I expected as, first of all, <u>this requires discipline and time</u>. For example, sometimes you don't want to go to the gym. You say to yourself that nothing will happen if you skip one workout. But you understand that if you do it once, nothing will prevent you from doing it regularly. Secondly,  when you eat fast food, you don't have to think at all. You take whatever you see in a shop just to make your stomach full. But if you start eating healthy food, you think about its nutritional value, you count calories and try to choose fresh high-quality meat, fruit and vegetables.</p><p>In any case, all these efforts are worth changing the way you live. For instance, it was not until I started following a healthy diet and doing sport regularly that <u>I began to lose weight naturally without starving myself</u>. As a result, <u>I started looking slimmer and feeling better</u>. What's more, <u>I became much more attractive for the opposite sex</u>. Now I have many admirers who say that I'm beautiful, and my photos get really many likes in social networks. My health has improved significantly since I started taking the first steps towards changing my life. <u>I have started feeling more energetic</u> than before. <u>This has also helped me get better skin</u>, so now I don't look as pale as before. To sum up, <u>the quality of my life has improved dramatically</u>."

So we had to make a software implementation plan ourselves. <u>Five of us teamed up to work on this project</u>. <u>And my boss asked me to take the lead on it</u>. </p><p>At first, we wanted to find the right CRM solution for our company's needs. I made a list of CRM vendors, and each team member had to evaluate at least one CRM system. Then we all worked together to plan and manage the implementation schedule, provide employee training, and ensure a smooth transition for our employees.  <p>As a team lead, <u>I was responsible for making sure team members were productive, the project remained within budget, and deadlines were met</u>. Also, <u>I had to organize training sessions, weekly webinars, and blog posts that all employees of our company could access if and when they needed help or guidance</u>. </p><p>It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. First of all, I had a hard time motivating people to work overtime because we couldn't ignore our everyday work duties. Plus, I faced resistance from many employees in our company 'cause their first thought was that the new software would be too difficult to learn, or it would disrupt their comfort levels, or even replace their jobs.

And in most cases, I don't notice that some item is missing for a long time… if ever… However, recently there was one case that I remember very well. This is because <u>I lost my phone</u>, and it was a total disaster because I am not ashamed to say that <u>I can't survive even an hour without the device</u>. It's like my best friend.<p>So, one day I returned home after a busy day and wanted to text one of my friends, but I couldn't find my phone. <u>At first, I didn't worry at all</u>. I asked my mom to call my phone ‘cause I was sure it was somewhere in my purse or in one of the pockets. What we heard was ‘the phone you dialled is not available at the moment'. This meant that locating my phone fast and easily was out of question. I thought the battery had gone flat, therefore it would just take a little  more time to find it. I searched high and low, but the search was without success. I realized I'd lost it. </p><p>At that very moment <u>I felt like my heart was coming to a complete stop</u>. <u>I started panicking</u>. I thought that someone would hack my phone password and get access to my photos and notes, my accounts on social media, which was the last thing I wanted to have happened. I thought of the potential consequences of my being out of contact for what might be several days. Among other things, <u>it was an expensive item, and I'd been saving for a long time to afford it</u>. </p><p>The worst thing about it was that <u>I had no idea where I lost it</u>. <u>I found out there was a hole in my pocket that I didn't realize was there</u>. So <u>this might have happened in a taxi</u>. Or <u>I may have left it in a changing room in the department store</u>. The only thing I remember was that I called my friend after I left the office. This means I didn't leave it in the workplace. But I wished I had. <u>I was upset and frustrated</u>. And <u>I was really angry about the whole thing</u>. But anyway, I never saw my phone again."

I'm saying ‘funniest' because I used to roll my eyes at those who entered giveaways and sweepstakes. <p> I thought it was just a waste of time because I was convinced that brands and bloggers create giveaways just to increase the number of followers, but never give prizes. I mean I thought winners weren't picked at random. I thought they announced winners just for show. But, in fact, the whole thing was fixed from the start. </p><p>However, during the lockdown it was so boring to stay home 24 hours a day, 7 days a week that I decided to enter a giveaway contest. </p><p>There's a tech blogger who constantly posts some of the coolest tech and gadget updates on his Instagram. And back then I noticed that he announced a giveaway contest. By that moment, I had been following him on Instagram for quite a while. Moreover, I saw the little blue checkmark next to his IG account name, which meant the account was officially verified by Instagram. So I said to myself ‘You've got nothing to lose'. </p><p>All I had to do was post a video or picture on social media using the contest hashtag, write an interesting caption, and then wait for a few weeks.</p><p>To be honest, I didn't expect to win anything. I even forgot about the giveaway. So I was totally happy when I found out that I won such a great prize."

She is <u>one of my close friends</u> and <u>the first person I rush to when I need a creative solution to some problem</u>, be it preparing a birthday present or decorating a flat. <p><u>I met Mary by accident</u>. Some years ago I was planning to have my flat refurbished, so I was looking for interior design ideas as I had no idea of what to do. I found her page on Facebook where she shared some ideas which were great yet easy to implement. I decided to ask her for advice. So I sent her a message. <u>She befriended me on Facebook first</u> and gradually we became very close friends in real life. </p><p>She is living proof that a creative person is creative in everything. First of all, she's a wizard with her hands. <u>She makes unbelievably beautiful clay dolls</u> which have a special meaning and serve as protective charms. What I admire most is that <u>she can turn ordinary items into design objects</u>. One of such examples is such <u>a lamp made of plastic spoons and bottles</u>. It looks incredibly stylish. </p><p>I don't know how <u>she manages to come up with new wonderful ideas every time I ask her for help</u>. And this happens <u>every time I want to congratulate my friends or relatives on their birthdays</u>. For instance, once she advised me <u>to record a song</u> for my boyfriend. Another time she helped me <u>make a fancy cake</u>. The most recent creative solution was to hide a present and make a map with prompts and riddles which my boyfriend used to find the gift. <u>I wish I could come up with the same original ideas</u>. However, <u>I'm nowhere near as creative as her</u>."

It's like a perfect mix of lots of open green areas, beautiful art, and amazing architecture. <p>In the middle of the park, there's this gorgeous pond with a fountain in the middle that shoots water really high up. There are plenty of benches around the pond, and I usually like to sit there and watch the water. The trees in the park always look fantastic. They are beautifully kept, like the ones you see in those old movies with grand royal palaces. And there's a nice path that goes all the way around it. I pretty much go there every day to keep myself healthy by going for a brisk walk or a jog. </p><p>Sometimes, I go to the park to read and enjoy the beautiful songs of the birds. In my opinion, it's the best spot to unwind and escape the busy city center. I can also check out or join in on outdoor events like music concerts and fairs, which is awesome because I love good music, and there are always talented musicians performing there. I'm often amazed by the stunning views, especially the breathtaking sunset. That's one of the things that keeps me coming back. You know, the more often I visit it, the more I love it. It's like magic, especially at night when it's all lit up."

But whatever the occasion, there's one dish that you'll always see on a festive table. The dish I'm talking about is <u>roast chicken</u>. And the main reason why it's so popular is that it's always a safe bet. First of all, I've never met people who have allergy to chicken. Also, it's very easy to cook. And it doesn't take much time. Another reason is that it's really hard to find someone who doesn't like its taste. <p>So, it's a very simple dish, yet really tasty. I mean it's tasty even if you just season it with salt and black pepper, rub a little oil all over the chicken skin, and cook until golden. But for special occasions, people try to make it a little more sophisticated and add garlic, herbs or sauces. </p><p>I particularly like roast chicken thighs because they have crispy skin, and because they are juicy, especially when they are marinated. What I usually do is carefully part the skin from the meat of the chicken and stuff the gap with fresh, delicate herbs such as parsley, basil and marjoram. Then I tie it up and roast it with some olive oil and salt. I cook until it is crispy and cooked through. </p><p>So recipes may differ a little, but the result is the same: tender meat with crispy skin. It is always so good that it practically melts in the mouth. "

Animals cannot verbally communicate their pain. So, having a professional who can <u>make an accurate diagnosis of your pet's condition and provide effective treatment recommendations</u> is a real blessing because the same symptoms could be caused by many different infections and diseases. <p>I'm lucky to know an expert whom I can fully trust and count on. Moreover, I recommend this vet to others without being afraid that some people will have negative experience dealing with her. Her name's Helen. <u>And she's considered one of the luminaries of veterinary medicine</u>. I know that <u>many other acknowledged specialists in the field respect her and often ask for advice</u>. And that's saying a lot, to my mind. </p><p>She is so good at her job that people come to her veterinary clinic from all over the country even though they sometimes have to travel very long distances several times a week or month to have an appointment with her. She has patients in other countries too. She is able to make an accurate diagnosis even without seeing an animal. All you need is to give her the results of all the tests she has asked for. </p><p>It may sound implausible, but she can work miracles. She treats animals when other vets throw up their hands in despair and either say they don't know what to do or it's too late to do something. And she doesn't give up if there's even the slightest chance to rescue an animal. </p><p>She is a really dedicated professional. If there is an emergency, she will help you no matter where she is and what she does. You can contact her after midnight, and she won't sleep the whole night if life of your pet is at stake."

And then he worked as a doctor for many years. He examined, diagnosed and treated patients. He literally worked day and night. I think it was hard. Very hard. But I'm sure that he did exactly what he was born to do, and he wouldn't have changed his job for all the world. For him, it wasn't just a job, it was his calling. <p> My grandfather's work occupied all his time. He never had a second job. It was just impossible as he had no time for that. If he had had a second job, he would have died of fatigue. Sometimes I doubted my grandfather was a human being. He didn't have hobbies. He didn't meet friends. He even missed most family gatherings. You know, it's not fun at all. He was always tired, and his eyes were always red because of endless sleepless nights. When he wasn't on duty, he was reading different books and reviewing medical records of his patients. </p><p>In my opinion, it is a very rewarding job. But I wouldn't like to do anything like that because it's really stressful, especially when you understand that you cannot help some patient. Also, doing shift work is not my cup of tea. I can't imagine myself working night shifts. What's more, I don't want to sacrifice everything for work. "

When I saw it, <u>it was lying on the concrete floor in a kind of trance as if it was waiting to die</u>. I think <u>it's cruel to confine a big carnivore to a tiny, dark, artificial, unenriched enclosure where it never sees any daylight </u>. <u>I was really sorry for that poor tiger that didn't even have a chance to seek privacy from the public and didn't have an opportunity to take part in natural behavior such as running, jumping or climbing</u>. Also, <u>I was a bit terrified</u>. <u>I was afraid the animal would somehow escape from the cage and bite me to death</u>. On the one hand, I knew the cage was strong enough so this was an unlikely occurrence, but there are always ‘what ifs' in the mind, which make you feel nervous seeing a big wild animal not far from you.</p><p>So, this was one of the most unpleasant experiences in my life, and I really hope I won't have to go to a zoo in the future.

First, I wanted to find a suitable one online, but I was overwhelmed by the number of options available. In the end, I decided to go to <u>a reputable electronics store</u> as it was too expensive a purchase for me to throw money away and buy the first thing I saw online. <p>When I entered the store, <u>one of the sales assistants greeted me</u>. <u>He waited for some time to let me look around, then approached me only after I made eye contact with him, showing I needed his assistance</u>. The guy introduced himself and <u>started asking me a lot of questions to find out what exactly I needed</u>. While listening, he didn't interrupt me, <u>he listened to me really carefully and did want to find the right solution for my individual needs</u> not just sell me something because that something would pay him more. Also, <u>he was knowledgeable about the product and very patient</u>. If I'd been him, I would have killed me as I asked a dozen silly questions, and some of them more than once. Unfortunately, the laptop I'd chosen appeared to be out of stock, so <u>he  offered to contact other branches to find the model I wanted</u>. Again, he didn't try to sell something what I didn't need. That is where I would say normal service ends. Of course, I agreed to wait a bit. </p><p>It took him about a week to find the laptop I wanted, but, in the meantime, <u>he phoned me a couple of times to let me know how it was going</u>. I think it it the intermediate phone calls that made this exceptional. <u>He let me know that he hadn't forgotten about me</u>. It may not sound like much, but <u>it really made me feel valued as a customer</u>. In my opinion, <u>he went beyond what the company would require or expect to find a positive solution and to provide me with good  service</u>. And I really appreciated that."

I can tell she's an avid reader because she shares not only professional content but also personal stories to connect with her followers. <p>She often posts reading lists. And due to this I know she enjoys reading books that focus on business strategies, leadership, and entrepreneurship. Also, she loves books about self-improvement, motivation, and developing new skills. And she likes to read novels. By the way, when I want to read a new book, I often choose from her recommendations. She doesn't just give the book titles; she also reviews them and explains why the book is valuable. What's interesting is that last year, she challenged herself to read 52 books in a year, and she did it. This caused a debate in the comments. Many people wrote that it’s impossible to properly absorb information when reading one book a week, and that she was just doing it to check it off quickly. But she doesn’t care about that. She believes that we consume content every day anyway, so it's better to do it consciously and spend an hour reading a good book rather than getting lost in TikToks. </p><p>Her Instagram feed has many photos of her with books in different places, as well as photos of just books. You don't need to follow her for long to see that she loves reading. It's clear from her profile."

But recently, I came across a video on YouTube that completely changed my mind. It showed a stunning, modern house with a sleek design, a big backyard with grass, and an in-ground pool. I was blown away when I saw it. It was exactly the kind of place I would love to stay in for a while.<p>The house in the video was a rectangular, ultra-modern home with clean, straight lines, made of concrete, steel, and glass. The outside was either white or black, but honestly, the color didn’t matter much. What really caught my attention was the overall design - a geometric building without a traditional roof, just a smooth, modern structure. </p><p>Inside, the house was just as incredible. It was a two-story home with an open floor plan, high ceilings, and big floor-to-ceiling windows that filled the space with natural light. The style was minimalist, but it had some loft-style elements like concrete walls, oak floors, and marble accents. I loved how modern and simple it looked, yet it still felt warm and comfortable. </p><p>Of course, the house was equipped with all the latest technology—remote control heating, lighting, sound systems, automatic blinds, and even floor heating and cooling. One of my favorite features was the surround sound system that played music throughout the house. </p><p>It was definitely a large house—tall ceilings, spacious rooms, huge staircases, garages for several cars, and every room you could dream of. There was a kitchen, dining room, walk-in closets, media room, home office, and even bathrooms with whirlpool tubs. It had everything to make staying there feel like a dream. I think a house like this would be perfect in a big city like London or New York, where it would really stand out."

But <u>if I were, I'd go to our local Historical Museum</u>. <p>I haven't been there myself. I just often walk past the building when I'm in the city center. It's a big, old building. It has tall windows and a large wooden door at the front. It's hard not to notice it when you walk by because it contrasts with the modern buildings around it. <u>It really stands out</u>. But those who have been there say it's quite interesting. </p><p>I imagine the Historical Museum might have a section where they showcase old tools and household items. There could be antique sewing machines, old-fashioned lamps, and even historical toys that children used to play with. Also, I think the museum might feature a display of traditional clothing from different periods. They could have old dresses, suits, and accessories that show how fashion has evolved over time. It might include a room with vintage agricultural equipment, like old plows and farming tools to help visitors understand how farming practices have changed throughout history. I suppose there might be an exhibit on old transportation methods too. They could have models of early cars, horse-drawn carriages, and even antique bicycles to show how people got around in the past… And various other exhibits that demonstrate how our society's culture has evolved over time, including changes in technology, daily life, and social customs… </p><p><u>What I know for sure is that</u> the museum also teaches visitors about how these past lifestyles contributed to shaping our nation's culture. As I mentioned before, I often walk past it and see announcements about special events. For example, last month, they had a ‘History Day’ where children could dress up in old-fashioned clothes and learn how to make simple toys from the past. My friend went and said it was a lot of fun. Even though I’m not very interested in museums, it does sound like a good time."

In my country, virtually every household has ceramics of various shapes and sizes, which are used for different purposes. For instance, as far back as I can remember, my mother always used clay pots for cooking. I remember she would always say <u>'there is no healthy cooking without healthy cookware'</u>.  I really liked everything my mom cooked in clay pots. She steamed veggies and stewed meat.  <u>The taste was truly exceptional</u>. <p>So when an opportunity turned up, <u>I went to the artisan village and bought a few pots for my own family</u>. By the way, it is these villages that are considered the best places where all this stuff is produced and sold. </p><p>When I was there, I watched a kind of a performance. Craftsmen showed how they produced different crafted items. But <u>I'm afraid I can't go into detail about the production process as it was quite a while ago</u>. <u>The only thing I remember is that clay was first dampened</u> 'cause when dampened, it behaves like plasticine. Then <u>it was modeled, dried, and then fired</u>. Of course, I didn't see all the stages as this process is long and complicated. And I didn't have so much time to wait for each stage to be completed. Anyway, we got a broad idea of what the process is like.</p><p>I really like ceramics for many reasons. If we talk about pottery, for example, <u>it is healthy and non-toxic</u>. Glassware and porcelain make very good presents</u>. And this list can be endless. It is no wonder that ceramics have become a traditional product in my country. "

And, in my opinion, <u>by far the most important one is the Ganges</u>. <u>It's the longest river in India which originates high in the Himalayan Mountains, flows for about 3000 kilometres through the country and discharges into the Bay of Bengal</u>. <u>The Ganges has a lot of tributaries</u>, which I can't name. What I know for sure is <u>it flows in 5 states of India and passes through a number of towns on its way to the Bay of Bengal</u>. As a result, <u>the river has a myriad of uses in the regions it passes through</u>. <p>First of all, <u>it is the most sacred river in India</u>. It is worshiped as the goddess Ganga Ma or Mother Ganges. <u>There are large religious festivals that occur in the river throughout the year where millions of people travel to the river to bathe, cleanse and purify their sins</u>. Also, people bring their dead to the river for cremation along its banks, and afterward their ashes are spread in the river. In some cases corpses are also thrown into the river.  </p><p><u>The Ganges River provides livelihood for a large number of people in my country as most of the people living on its banks use the river for daily needs such as bathing and fishing</u>. By the way, <u>its basin is the most heavily populated in the world with over 400 million people living there</u>. </p><p><u>The river also plays an important role in the economy of my country as it provides irrigation water for agriculture, and it is the backbone of the country's river transport system</u>. I'm not quite sure, but I think <u>it's a source of electricity</u> as well. "

When I was about 7, my dad came home with a giant box. When I opened it, I saw a brown bear with a big head and black beady eyes staring at me. I started leaping for joy because this toy had been on my wishlist for a long time and I begged parents for it. It was really cute and cuddly. The whole next day I was really busy choosing the best name for my fluffy furry friend. I'm afraid it wasn't original but I called my teddy Winnie, after my favourite cartoon character Winnie-the-Pooh. It became my best buddy for many years.<p>Not that I didn't like spending time with my peers, but unlike my friends, Winnie was always by my side, sharing all the moments of my life. I dragged it around everywhere. Once I found out that one eye was missing. I tried to find it, but didn't succeed. I was really upset because I thought it wouldn't have happened if I had looked after Winnie more carefully. So my mom had to get a replacement on the same evening.</p><p>Winnie and I spent a lot of time together. I fed it and talked to it. In the evenings I read stories to my teddy bear. When it got sick, I treated it with pretend tea and honey. It is without doubt I took it to bed and it even had its own pillow. Probably it was Winnie that chased away bad dreams. I also taught my bear to read and write, and it was a really assiduous student. Besides, my Winnie must have been the most fashionable bear of all. In the summer it had on some shorts, a tee shirt, sandals, sunglasses, and a hat. When it was cold and wintry out, I would put on it a jacket, sweater, boots, shoes, and a cute snowy hat!  Winnie is much more than a toy, it is a symbol of my childhood, so it is still with me, hibernating in one of my closets."

He said it was easier for him to work all night long than to make an omelette, let alone some exquisite dishes like lasagna or soup. </p><p>So I said I would forgive him if he could make <u>my favourite three-tier chocolate biscuit cake</u>. And I told him I would sit and watch him cooking to make sure he didn't cheat. <p></p>He found a video recipe on the Internet and just followed all the instructions step by step. First, he baked several cakes and made chocolate mousse. Then he assembled the cake, stacking the layers on top of each other. Also, <u>he experimented with cake decorations a bit (who would've thought) and finally decided to make a chocolate lace collar around the bottom and middle cakes</u>. The cake looked gorgeous. The crumb was <u>delicate and moist, the frosting was rich and creamy and utterly chocolatey</u>. <u>It was filled with buttercream, fresh fruit, and nuts</u>. <u>He sprinkled the top tier of the cake with chocolate curls and dusted it with confectioners sugar</u>.</p><p>My jaw dropped to the floor.

Last Monday wasn't an exception. <u>Traffic moved very slowly, and there was no end in sight</u>. The closer to the city centre, the more slowly. This maked me really nervous. <p>As a result, <u>I was late for an important meeting</u>. In fact, if only I could leave home just 15 minutes earlier, I would get to the office without any problems very fast. Normally it takes not more than 15 minutes. But I never manage to. </p><p>Another thing that made me irritated, and it always does, was that <u>I wasted a lot of time</u>. What I mean is when I'm stuck in a traffic jam, for example, because of a car accident, and don't move, I take my tablet and write letters or do other important things. But last time cars were crawling, the only thing I could do was to scroll down my news feed on Facebook, which didn't improve my productivity and didn't do any good to me. </p><p>Also, <u>traffic congestion usually entails additional expenses</u>. I've recently read that for every two minutes a car is idling, it uses the same amount of fuel as a mile's drive. </p><p>What's more, <u>it increases vehicle emissions</u>, so every morning I blame myself for contributing to environmental pollution, which I can avoid only if I stop getting to work by car, which is out of question.

But at some point, <u>the guide started walking faster, and suddenly I realized I had lagged behind the rest of the group</u>. <p>To my regret, my phone had died, so I could neither call the guide or use Google Maps. Then <u>I asked some passers-by for directions, but they were tourists, just like me</u>. <u>They just shrugged their shoulders and apologized for not being able to help me</u>. After that <u>I decided to retrace my way, but it appeared to be more difficult than it seemed as there were many winding and narrow streets which looked exactly the same</u>. So <u>I ended up walking round in circles</u>. I had no idea how to get back to the bus. I understood that I would have to take a taxi to return to the hotel. So I stopped worrying about it, relaxed and continued exploring the city on foot. I guess I walked more than 20 000 steps on that day.

I felt I just wasted my time doing nothing. I sometimes literally stared at the screen trying to collect my thoughts. Plus, I got easily distracted. The main problem about it is that once you get distracted, it takes about 20 minutes to return to our original task. I was stressed and overworked. <p>My friend recommended me to practice <u>mindfulness meditation in the mornings</u>. I'll explain what it is. It's simply <u>focusing completely on what you're doing, slowing down, and observing all of the physical and emotional sensations that you are experiencing in that moment</u>. This is the skill that I really needed to master. She told me <u>to sit still and focus on my breath, then concentrate on the beating of my heart</u>. The most important thing was not not pay any attention to anything else. </p><p>But I'm a very active person. So you can imagine... I was absolutely terrified at the thought of sitting still, even for a couple of minutes, let alone half an hour. At first, it was indeed a nightmare. I couldn't get rid of the incessant chatter in my head. My thoughts were driving me crazy. And therefore I couldn't slow down and make my mind relaxed. Plus, it was boring. </p><p>Despite this, I didn't give up and practiced it every morning. Gradually I got used to it and even started enjoying the process. Just a week later <u>I saw measurable improvements in attention span</u>. I saw that <u>I could easily center the thoughts on what I did</u>. Later I started directing focused attention towards my ordinary activities. For instance, I  practiced mindfulness when I ate. I took time to really chew my food and concentrate on its flavors and texture. </p><p>Now if I'm working on some task and feel that restless itch to go do something else, I try to bring my awareness to my body and my breath. After a few seconds of focusing on my breath, I'm normally ready to get back to work. "

But I couldn't pack up and go to a country where English is spoken natively, so I knew I had to find a way to always get exposed to it at home. <p>All my friends said I had to subscribe to Netflix and start watching series and TV shows in English. And this is what I did. I remember I started with a TV series which I had already seen in my own language. It was Friends. Who hasn't watched Friends? After that I always found what to watch. First, I watched films and series in English with the subtitles in my own language, so I could check the meaning of any vocabulary I didn't know easily. Later, I had the subtitles in English, and paused if the characters spoke too quickly. When I started feeling more confident, I watched each episode without subtitles. I used the 10 second 'back' button to try again and again to catch all the new words and conversational phrases. Then I played each scene again, and watched the scene with English subtitles on. Then I looked them up and watched the scene AGAIN to see how these new words were used in the context. I watched each episode as many times as I needed to get used to the speed, pronunciation, and common expressions used. After that, I always practiced SHADOWING, which I'm sure really helped improve my fluency. I tried to repeat what they were saying at the same time. Again, I used my favorite ten second 'back' button to practice saying and repeating some short phrases a few times. </p><p>I believe watching Netflix series and TV shows helped me a lot as I learned the most current version of a language, stuff that may not even exist in textbooks. I learned to speak naturally and easily. And it helped me develop my listening skills. What's important is that it was never boring. "

We could open a restaurant. Actually, we could start whatever business we want. <p>The main reason why I want to go into business with him is that I'm sure he is able to build a very successful company 'cause he's a natural-born entrepreneur. All our relatives say that if he started a business, he would make lots and lots of money. And I want to be involved (LOL). As far as I remember, as a child, he came up with lots of quick and easy ways to make money almost every day. For example, he did a lot of garage sales. When he ran out of junk from our parents' garage to sell, he asked his friends if they could organize garage sales at their houses. Also, he sold homemade lemonade in the summer. Once, and that's one of my favourite stories, he figured out that he could invest, say, $3 into buying the whole pizza and then sell it by the slice. So he was able to charge something like $4 or $5 for a pizza that cost him just $3. I consider him a genius. And I think these stories prove that he does have a business flair. So everyone says that it's a pity that he  used his talent only when he was a kid. What's more, he already has extensive experience in sales, which is sometimes key to success in business. Also, we complement each other very well. We would engage in different activities and have different responsibilities. So I believe there would be less reason to fight. Finally, what's important is that we know each other inside out and I know I can trust him. "

And at some point, we realised that all of us wanted to do something more entertaining than just sitting around and chatting. One of my friends suggested trying <u>an escape room</u>, you know, a game in which a team of people is locked in a room. <u>And they must find clues and solve puzzles to complete a given mission and find the key to escape</u>. I GOT SUPER PSYCHED ABOUT THE IDEA 'cause it was something I hadn't done before. We did a quick online search for escape rooms in that area and chose the one that had lots of good customer reviews. <p>There were 4 of us. So it cost just about 10 dollars per person, which is not expensive at all. We were kind of spies who broke into someone's house to find some secret files. Frankly speaking, I don't remember the storyline in detail, but I remember that we had one hour to escape the room to avoid being caught and imprisoned.</p><p>The room, in which we were locked, was packed with different stuff such as books, maps, fedoras, magnets, sticky notes, watches, old wigs, compasses, lamps, board games, playing cards. We were frantically searching for clues. Some of them involved solving riddles, putting items in the correct order, or finding a set of objects hidden in the room. <u>The puzzles were really challenging</u>. </p><p><u>And it was real fun</u>. What I will never forget is that there was a broken clock, and for a long time we couldn't figure out that we had to pay attention to the time it stopped on. By the way, it appeared to be the last clue. </p><p>It was completely different from what we usually do together. And to tell the truth, I didn't expect it to be so exciting. "

He promised we would spend the whole day out the next weekend. And we did. My husband suggested having <u>a bike ride through the countryside</u>. I agreed despite the fact that I hadn't ridden a bicycle since childhood. <p>So we rented two bikes, which didn't cost a lot. And we went to our country house that is located in a very picturesque area near the coniferous forest. Funnily enough, we only had barbeque parties in the garden there and had never explored the beautiful nature around.We took some food because we didn't know if we would return fast or spend the whole day cycling. And we took a navigator not to get lost somewhere in the middle of nowhere. </p><p>At first, I was riding at a snail's pace. I was concentrating solely on balancing and steering, and, of course, I didn't look around and couldn't appreciate the beautiful scenery. But <u>it was fun</u>. <u>It was a bit like being a kid again</u>. I soon got the hang of it and started riding confidently. There were cows grazing in green fields, ducks hiding in the grass, beautiful wild flowers and butterflies. We often stopped to take photos and enjoy the stunning scenery. </p><p>In general, it wasn't a strenuous tour. Whenever we felt tired, we just wheeled our bikes. </p><p>In the evening we returned to our starting point and went home. This bike trip helped me recharge my batteries, and it was real fun. "

But I don't have enough money for it 'cause it requires huge investment. And this is a big problem as while I'm still thinking, someone else is acting. I want to create a blockchain-powered educational marketplace. It will be like Coursera and eBay mixed together. Both content creators and students will benefit from it because smart contracts that are used by the blockchain technology will guarantee easy, fast, safe and commission-free payments. And no one will have to control the whole system as the system will regulate itself. So what I want is to take part in <u>a startup battle</u> and <u>pitch my project to investors</u>. <p>I've already done some research, and now I know more or less what I need to do to enter such a  competition. </p><p>At first, I have to submit an entry which is processed by a panel of judges. If they feel that angel investors may take interest in the project, I move to the next stage. As a rule, <u>finalists are selected to pitch on stage or have one-to-one short meetings with potential investors</u>. I'll have to prepare a detailed business plan, write a powerful pitch and prepare an investor offer 'cause no one will invest a lot of money in the project if I cannot explain how exactly it will generate profit for investors. </p><p>I suppose <u>such a competition will allow me to test my idea to see how viable it is</u>. I will have <u>a chance to prove to everyone that my idea is worth implementing</u>. In the best-case scenario, <u>I will attract investment to develop my project</u>.  Also, ><u>I'll get much needed PR coverage through local (national or international) media</u>. I really want to make a difference in the world and become as famous as Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. And even if it all goes wrong, I'll get invaluable experience in order to get better prepared next time and not to make the same mistakes.  In any case, <u>it will be a good opportunity to get my business idea evaluated by independent experts</u>. And I'm sure <u>it will be a stepping stone to achieve something great in life</u>."

What I did first was <u>I read a lot of articles in magazines and consulted a dietician</u> because without professional help diets may do more harm than good. The biggest challenge was to <u>stop eating fast food</u>. I started to choose carefully what I ate, when and what for. I became a frequent visitor of a gym and <u>did exercises regularly</u>. At least 3 times per week.<p>I've been living like this for more than a year now. I have to confess that this appeared to be more difficult than I expected as, first of all, this requires discipline and time. For example, sometimes you don't want to go to the gym. You say to yourself that nothing will happen if you skip one workout. But you understand that if you do it once, nothing will stop you from doing it regularly. Secondly, when you eat fast food, you don't have to think at all. You take whatever you see in a shop just to make your stomach full. But if you start eating healthy food, you think about its nutritional value, you count calories and try to choose fresh high-quality meat, fruit and vegetables.</p><p>In any case, all these efforts are worth changing the way you live. For instance, it was not until I started following a healthy diet and doing sport regularly that <u>I began to lose weight naturally without starving myself</u>. As a result, <u>I started looking slimmer and feeling better</u>. What's more, <u>I became much more attractive for the opposite sex</u>. Now I have many admirers who say that I'm beautiful, and my photos get really many likes in social networks. My health has improved significantly since I started taking the first steps towards changing my life. <u>I have started feeling more energetic</u> than before. <u>This has also helped me get better skin</u>, so now I don't look as pale as before. To sum up, <u>the quality of my life has improved dramatically</u>."

For me, the process of preparation is a chore to be endured. But at least once a year I have to organise <u>my birthday party</u>. <p>I have a birthday in August. So as you understand, I went through the whole process <u>just a couple of months ago</u>. This time I started preparing a party one month before the date as I didn't want to do everything at the last minute like I usually do.</p><p>First of all, <u>I chose a date</u> for the party. Thank God, I didn't need to make sure that most of my friends were free because they know that I always celebrate my birthday on the same  day as I was born. It has been so for many years, so they don't plan anything on that day. I planned to invite quite a few guests, so obviously I couldn't invite them to my place as my dwelling is just a one-room flat. For this reason, <u>I booked a table at my favourite restaurant, I ordered food, drinks and a birthday cake</u>. <u>I ordered big colourful balloons and prepared a basket of props handy for people to use to take funny photos</u>. You know, some funny hats and glasses. <u>I discussed a party playlist</u>. </p><p>To tell the truth, although it may seem that I didn't do a lot, the process was really <u>tiring</u>. First of all, though I started well in advance, <u>I was pressed for time</u>. Secondly, <u>I didn't want to spend a fortune</u>, so I had to choose everything carefully and compare prices in different places. And sometimes it was difficult for me to make up my mind about some things such as what dishes to choose, what colour balloons to order. Such things. But the party was even better than I expected. "

I rushed there, opened the door and what I saw made me totally shocked. Water was gushing out from the broken faucet.  <p>Of course, it didn't happen unexpectedly. It was bound to happen sooner or later. First of all, the faucet was old. And it should have been replaced, but we were always too busy to deal with it. And we kept putting it off. What's more, we just ignored the harbingers of the impending disaster. For example, a few days before this happened I noticed the faucet was dripping. I told my husband about it, but he said there was absolutely nothing to worry about. </p><p>A few days later it became apparent that there was something to worry about. The worst thing was that it was almost midnight. So there was very little chance that we would find a 24-hour emergency plumbing repair service. In any case, we had to deal with the problem urgently. What we did immediately was turn off water at the main shutoff valve, which is at the water meter. Thank God, it didn't take us much time to find it. That's all we could do ourselves. The next morning I contacted a local plumbing repair service and scheduled a service call for plumbing repair 'cause fixing is not my husband's forte. </p><p>It was a nightmare, but I was feeling happy 'cause we didn't flood our neighbours."

Without exaggeration, I think that <u>smartphones  have revolutionized humanity</u>.<p><u>They allow us to do amazing things and interact with the world in ways we never thought were possible</u>. They can be used <u>for making and receiving calls, texting friends, family and colleagues, getting and sharing news on social networks sites, checking email messages and even doing online banking</u>. We also use them<u>to take photos</u>  and <u>keep track of calendar events</u>. For example, in the past, I used to depend too much on my home PC for doing tasks like checking mails and browsing the web. <u>Now that I have a smartphone, I no longer have to rush to a computer to edit a document or check my email</u>. So, first of all, <u>this invention has made our  lives much easier providing us with an easy and fast way of communication, enabling to do various tasks all at the same time and freeing us from the constraints of space</u>.  The second change brought by smartphones is that <u>they have replaced many devices such as ebook readers, MP3 players, or cameras</u>. If you want, <u>you can use them for listening to music or watching a film</u>. Also, there are apps for practically everything. They are quick to install and easy to use. Thus, <u>having a smartphone makes waiting not as boring as in the past</u>.</p><p>So I'm more than sure it's difficult to overestimate popularity of smartphones as wherever you go, you see <u>people that are literally glued to their devices</u>. Now <u>we just can't imagine our lives without these devices</u>. For instance, I use mine <u>all the time I am awake</u>. <u>I feel really weird if my phone isn't within close proximity to me</u>. <u> I feel cut off from the world if  the battery goes flat, and I don't have an opportunity to recharge it immediately</u>. To tell the truth, I kinda go into convulsions when I can't keep up with my Facebook feed for some time. What is more, <u>we are so dependent on our smartphones that some of us even use them while driving even though everybody  realises that they risk taking someone's life and ruining their own</u>. <u>I've read that currently there are more than one billion smartphone users in the world</u>. That's so impressive a figure. And this means that smartphones are more popular than computers. All these examples prove  that <u>the smartphone is by far the most significant invention ever</u>."

I told him to put on his winter coat, boots and a hat as I was afraid he would freeze to death. He said he would be back 5 minutes later. And he told me a story about a man who spent whopping 20 hours lying paralyzed in snow outside his home and didn't even have any frost bite. I was amazed to hear that. I asked how it was possible. And it appeared that the man was saved by his dog. <p>So, there was some man who decided to go outside for a moment, just like my father. He wasn't going to stay out in the cold for a long time that's why he was wearing slippers, trousers and a shirt. But he slipped and broke his neck. He couldn't stand up. He was lying in the snow screaming for help, but nobody could hear him. Luckily, his dog came to him and started barking for help. She kept him warm for about 20 hours by lying on top of him. Also, she kept him awake by licking his hands and face. If he had fallen asleep, he would have been doomed. The dog kept barking for help all night long. Thank God, she alerted the man's neighbour, who called the emergency services, and the man was taken to hospital. </p><p>The story moved me, but when my father finished it, I asked him to put on warm clothes because we didn't have a dog that would rescue him.

But no matter what I did I couldn't get all the work done. And I was really angry and frustrated.<p>So, now I know that creating a daily plan is enormously important. But <u>it's also necessary to peg a time limit to each task on the list</u>. I used to work slowly just because I didn't control the time. Sometimes I was trying to bring the result to perfection, which is pointless per se. Sometimes I was distracted by emails, calls messages or Facebook. You know, you want to quickly check something on Facebook or Instagram, but then you find yourself aimlessly scrolling the feed for half an hour. </p><p> What's more, <u>I set some awards and punishments  in order not to be tempted to text someone or scroll the feed on Facebook</u>. The main problem about it is that once you get distracted, it takes about 20 minutes to return to our original task. </p><p>Now I understand that I have a limited period of time to complete some task. So I just don't pay attention to the distractors and activities that waste my time.

One of the things he told me was that he started  thinking of investing his life savings in cryptocurrency. He said it was the best time to invest 'cause the price of bitcoin and several other leading cryptocurrencies had suffered huge falls in December, so the price of bitcoin plunged to about 70000 dollars, but some analysts are predicting the price of bitcoin could hit 100000 dollars by the end of the next year.  And there are a lot of new coins that he thinks will make a good investment as well.  One more reason why he said cryptocurrency could make a good investment is that everyone says cryptocurrency is the future 'currency of the internet' and ultimate store of wealth. What's more, transactions are fast, digital, secure and worldwide, which allows the maintenance of records without risk of data being pirated. </p><p>Despite all this, it was obvious he couldn't make up his mind. I'm sure what I told him didn't help him at all 'cause my knowledge of cryptocurrency is limited. All I could tell him was a couple of stories of bitcoin millionaires and losses. For instance, I told him a sad story of some guy who accidentally threw away 7500 bitcoins when he got rid of an old laptop hard drive. He bought them when they were worth 1 dollar. And they are worth over 200 million dollars today. He now wants to dig up his local rubbish tip, hoping to find the old drive. Also, I told him that if I were him, I wouldn't invest more than I can afford to lose, and that I wouldn't invest all my life savings. In my opinion, the discussion was really fruitful as it helped me form a balanced opinion on this matter. And now I'm planning to invest a small amount of money in bitcoin in the near future. But it seems to me my friend began to doubt even more."

I told him that I had already tried all the time management strategies, but nothing helped. He gave me a really simple, yet efficient solution to my problem. He advised me to stop making to-do lists because I planned much more than I could do. I saw the list and thought that I had to complete all the tasks on the list. He told me that to-do lists don't work for visual thinkers like me and <u>recommended me to start using a different approach to planning my day</u>. At first, he drew a circular diagram which looked like a clock face. Then he took my long to-do list and asked me to estimate how much time each of the tasks would consume. So he transferred the tasks from my to-do list to this diagram. Every time he shaded a sector for the task. At some point, there were no empty sectors on the first diagram. He drew the second one. And I realised that when I made lists of things to do, it seemed to me I was obliged to do everything on the list by the end of the day. I realised that the problem was not about poor productivity, but my inability to make realistic plans. <u>He taught me to set achievable goals and avoid planning too many things</u>. </p><p><u>I am convinced this was a clever solution because, first of all, it worked for me and helped me solve my problem fast and efficiently</u>. What's more, <u>it didn't require me to put any extra efforts into solving the problem</u>.

I made a list of CRM vendors, and each team member had to evaluate at least one CRM system. Then we all worked together to plan and manage the implementation schedule, provide employee training, and ensure a smooth transition for our employees. </p><p>I was responsible for making sure team members were productive, the project remained within budget, and deadlines were met. My personal assistant had to organise training sessions, weekly webinars, and blog posts so that all employees of our company could access if and when they need help or guidance. </p><p>One the one hand, <u>it was quite a challenge</u> 'cause I had to motivate people to work overtime because we couldn't ignore our everyday work duties. In addition, we faced resistance from some other employees in our company 'cause their first thought was that the new software would be too difficult to learn, or it would disrupt their comfort levels, or even replace their jobs. But this development did wonders for the company's performance. And I was happy I didn't choose to ignore the advice. All I could say was I wish we had started using this software much earlier. "

And I think that it is being authentic that helps her stand out from the crowd. Now many bloggers show only carefully curated, beautifully lit and perfectly filtered moments and think that this will help them connect with followers, but I think this strategy doesn't work. And she doesn't use it. She managed to find her 'blend' of content. It's obvious that she enjoys blogging. I'm sure this helps her keep her social media presence real. And this content resonates with many people. For example, in her opinion, sometimes it's okay to post without a filter, or even post about challenges and struggles. I really appreciate that. </p><p>And I am honestly impressed by her ability to create a personal brand, build an audience and develop influence, open up to strangers, and stay popular for so long given the fact that a niche of lifestyle blogging is over-saturated nowadays. I'm sure it's because she has never tried to be just like other successful lifestyle bloggers. That's why I enjoy reading her posts and watching her videos on YouTube. "

She said this helps her focus on what's really important to her although there are lots of people who say that we should seize every opportunity that we have. Another interesting idea of hers is not to try to improve more than 2 spheres of your life at a time. Otherwise, you risk spending the whole day digging deeper and deeper into all kinds of problems. As a result, you'll just have a low self-esteem and a bad mood. She also writes about difficulties she faces and what she does to overcome them. She writes about her achievements. It's inspiring. For example, sometimes she starts her post from 'This is how I did something, for example, started my own business at the age of 21 and how you can too'."

I couldn't say 'no' because we usually cover for each other, and I knew that I wouldn't be able to count on her in the future if I had refused to pick up her workload. So <u>I had to push myself beyond my limits to get all the work done</u>. <u>I had a constant flow of emails coming in</u>. Also, <u>I had to deal with customer requests and phone calls, let alone my daily reports</u>. Even when I came home after work, I couldn't relax because <u>I had to walk the dog</u> and make sandwiches and tea not to collapse from hunger as I didn't even have time for lunch. Also, in the mornings I woke up at the last minute, so breakfast was out of question in most cases.</p><p>To tell the truth, the only thing that literally saved me from burnout and overwork was my paper planner called <u>Slice Planner</u>. <u>This planner presents a work day as a diagram which looks like a clock face</u>. This diagram is divided into 12 sectors, like 12 hours. You have to shade the sector representing some time slot if you plan to do something during that period of time. Although I saw what fitted into my schedule and what didn't, I tried to do more work.</p><p>So, when this crazy time was over <u>I was squeezed like a lemon as I had to work against the clock to complete my project in time, so I didn't have days off during the whole month</u>. At the same time <u>I felt relieved as I understood I could finally relax for some time</u>. And, of course, <u>I had a sense of accomplishment</u> as my project was a real success. I even got a bonus for it."

It's like my best friend.<p>So, one day I returned home after a busy day and wanted to text one of my friends, but I couldn't find my phone. <u>At first, I didn't worry at all</u>. I asked my mom to call my phone ‘cause I was sure it was somewhere in my purse or in one of the pockets. What we heard was ‘the phone you dialled is not available at the moment'. This meant that locating my phone fast and easily was out of question. I thought the battery had gone flat, therefore it would just take a little  more time to find it. I searched high and low, but the search was without success. I realized I'd lost it. </p><p>At that very moment <u>I felt like my heart was coming to a complete stop</u>. <u>I started panicking</u>. I thought that someone would hack my phone password and get access to my photos and notes, my accounts on social media, which was the last thing I wanted to have happened. I thought of the potential consequences of my being out of contact for what might be several days. Among other things, <u>it was an expensive item, and I'd been saving for a long time to afford it</u>. </p><p>The worst thing about it was that <u>I had no idea where I lost it</u>. <u>I found out there was a hole in my pocket that I didn't realize was there</u>. So <u>this might have happened in a taxi</u>. Or <u>I may have left it in a changing room in the department store</u>. The only thing I remember was that I called my friend after I left the office. This means I didn't leave it in the workplace. But I wished I had. <u>I was upset and frustrated</u>. And <u>I was really angry about the whole thing</u>. But anyway, I never saw my phone again."

For example, just in 2018, there were 17 million new cancer cases and 9.5 million cancer deaths. What's more, treatment is super expensive and, in most cases, ineffective. </p><p>So, according to the news article, a team of scientists has discovered the first complete cure for cancer. The treatment is a multi-target toxin which specifically kills cancer cells. Also, they say that patients could likely stop treatment after a number of weeks and not need a drug cocktail throughout their lives.</p><p>The team has already concluded its first exploratory experiment on mice, and it had promising results. The experiment showed inhibited human cancer cell growth and had no effect on healthy mice cells. So, the company will soon begin clinical trials that could be completed within a few years and would make the treatment available in specific cases. </p><p>Frankly speaking, <u>I didn't expect such a discovery to happen in the not-too-distant future, therefore I was truly impressed and suprised by this piece of news</u>."

I usually move slowly, calmly, and mindfully. The older I become, the more I appreciate each opportunity to take the time to walk or sit and enjoy silence, especially <u>when  I feel that I'm on the verge of burnout</u>. When it's warm, <u>I spread down a small carpet and sit under a pine tree</u>, <u>reading a book or just enjoying the nature</u>.</p><p>This is by far the best place where <u>I can take a break from a constant stream of noises to reboot my brain and unwind</u>. Also, it is there that <u>I can rid my mind of negative and unnecessary thoughts, slow down, catch a deep breath, set my mind straight, think about my life and focus on what I really want</u>. If I'm feeling blue, a walk in the forest <u>helps me to set myself in the right mood</u>. <u>When I feel stressed and exhausted, it helps me to recharge my batteries</u>. </p><p>I usually notice a huge difference in the way I feel before and after I go there, and this is definitely what keeps me coming back for more.

John is retired. And if I were him, I would sleep late, but <u>he wakes up at 5 or 6 a.m. and always starts his day from morning exercises</u>. <u>He goes jogging, I think, every day regardless of the weather and the season</u>. I know about this 'cause when I go to work we often have small talk while waiting for an elevator because it usually doesn't come for ages. </p><p>Another thing that draws people to him is that <u>he will never say 'no' if you ask him to water your flowers when you're away, keep an eye on your flat or feed your pets</u>. I used to think he does it not to feel lonely, but some time ago I understood that this is just because <u>he is a really caring and considerate person</u>. </p><p>What's more, <u>whatever happens, he looks on the bright side of life</u>. Whenever I meet him, <u>he is in a good mood</u> with a big smile on his face. <u>He never complains about his life</u> although my parents told me that he'd got through a lot of challenges. <u>I wish there were more people like him</u>."

First of all, <u>I  didn't expect so many people to congratulate me</u>. I was really pleased as my phone kept ringing all day long and I received messages non-stop. In the evening, <u>I had a festive dinner with my family</u> which was just great as I was happy to see all my nearest and dearest and share an important moment with them. It was then that my parents gave me the present I'd been dreaming of and couldn't even imagine I would receive it in the near future. The following day <u>I invited my friends to the restaurant</u>. The party was unbelievably cool as <u>it was perfect from start to finish</u>. What's more, <u>it was completely different from all the other birthday parties I'd had before</u>. <u>My friends congratulated me in an unusual way</u>. For example, <u>they made a video in which each of them was giving their wishes to me</u>.  There were even those who were living abroad and those whom I hadn't seen for a long time. This surprise was best as it was the least expected. Also, they gave me a car cake as I am dreaming of buying one. One more thing they surprised me with was they had hidden their gifts and made me solve <u>riddles</u> which helped me to find them. Had it not been for these surprises, my birthday party wouldn't have been so exciting and fun. Apart from that, <u>we ate delicious food, sang karaoke and danced</u>. "

Just several weeks ago I was looking through the photos in a family album and recalled that event. <p>My great grandparents invited all the members of our family to <u>their house in the village</u>. Frankly speaking, it was a few years ago, so I don't remember everything in detail. <u>I guess much of what I think I remember is a product of my imagination</u>. <u>Every time I recall this event, I see memories flooding across my mind like a kaleidoscope of pictures</u>. For example, <u>there was a lot of food on the table</u> though I don't really remember whether it was tasty or not. <u>The guests were talking and laughing all the time</u>. <u>Some of them were dancing, others were just sitting and eating non-stop</u>. One more thing that I can't help remembering is <u>there was a firework display at night</u>.  Also, <u>there were huge bouquets of beautiful flowers everywhere</u>.</p><p>Thank God there is a photo taken during this event which depicts the whole family.

I'm not obsessed with cleanliness (though my husband says I am a clean freak), but I hate to see dust, crumbs, cat's hair and other particles on the floor, on carpets and on the furniture. I love my cat, but he sheds a ton of hair everywhere every day. It seems to me he drops more fur than one would think is possible. And I've got a chair that gets particularly covered in hair every day 'cause this is the place where my cat likes to chill. If I didn't vacuum every evening, there would be clumps of hair all over our clothes and everywhere. Plus, I like to walk around my flat barefoot, but I hate when my feet get dirty and when dirt and other particles stick to my feet. Again, the only way to prevent this from happening is to vacuum the floor and carpets every day. I love my husband and kids, but I hate to see little pieces of food, cracker and bread crumbs on the floor 'cause they like eating in the living room and don't feel guilty about it. <p>I'm happy that I have a really powerful vacuum cleaner which is specially designed for people who keep pets. It's a canister model which has the motor and dust collector, and the vacuum head connected to its main part by a flexible hose. It is a wheeled type and it has really high suction power, so I don't have to put too much effort in order to clean all the surfaces. It's compact and lightweight, therefore I don't have any difficulty using it. </p><p>So every evening I vacuum all the surfaces using different heads for different tasks. And I do it even if I feel drained after a hard working day. If it weren't for this vacuum cleaner, the whole flat would be covered in cat's hair, crumbs, dust, torn paper pieces and other particles, which would really annoy me. </p><p>Without exaggeration, I'm really happy that humanity once created this household device because it saves a lot of my time, and I clean the whole flat relatively fast."

But one of them seemed to be particularly interesting to me. <u>This was a young lady named Helen</u>.<p>At the very beginning each of us presented a short story in order to introduce ourselves to other group members. She said she was there because she was keen on Psychology. Also, from what other people knew about her I found out she was a successful businesswoman who owned an online store which sold unusual handmade gifts all over the world. During breaks between lectures she always disappeared and I didn't have an opportunity to talk to her in a relaxed atmosphere. I was really surprised to find out that during these breaks she always went to feed her newborn baby who was looked after by her mother while she was studying.</p><p>I wish I'd had an opportunity to get to know her. And I still want to get in touch with her in order to know more. <u>I'd like to find out how she manages to take care of her husband and children, always look impeccable, and run a successful business</u>. <u>Another thing I want to know is what makes her so energetic</u>. <u>I'd like to communicate with her to be like her because I really like that she always looks on the bright side of life and she has qualities that are in short supply nowadays</u>. Those who know her well say <u>she is industrious, ambitious, single-minded, knowledgeable, caring and risky</u>. I admire such people and want to surrond myself with people like her."

Her YouTube channel is dedicated to learning English. And, actually, this is how I found her. <p>One day I was looking for an accent reduction course on YouTube. I watched one of her videos, then another one. They were really engaging. I just couldn't stop watching them. I found her personal account on Instagram and started following her. </p><p>Her posts proved to be even more interesting than her videos because she wrote a lot about her life in America, described her business strategies, shared her insights with the audience. So I've been following her on Instagram for almost a year now. I still find her ideas interesting, so I never miss her posts, especially those that she writes after attending some events. </p><p><u>I'm sure it is her ideas and beliefs have helped her achieve the results I'm dreaming about</u>. So I try to apply some of these things to my life. <u>Some of her ideas are totally different from mine, thus, they made me look at things from a different perspective</u>. </p><p>For example, in one of her recent posts she said she started to say more noes than yeses. She said this helps her focus on what's really important to her although there are lots of people who say that we should seize every opportunity that we have. Another interesting idea of hers is not to try to improve more than 2 spheres of your life at a time. Otherwise, you risk spending the whole day digging deeper and deeper into all kinds of problems. As a result, you'll just have low self-esteem and a bad mood. She also writes about difficulties she faces and what she does to overcome them. She writes about her achievements. It's inspiring. For example, sometimes she starts her post from 'This is how I did something, for example, started my own business at the age of 21 and how you can too.'"

I think this is a bit over the top. So if all people acted like this, the rule would be justified. </p><p>But there are also many people like me. I would only grab just a few items for later 'cause I prefer to relax with my coffee and breakfast in my room rather than in the breakfast room. I think there is nothing wrong with taking food from a hotel's breakfast room as long as it's the same amount as I would have taken if eating IN the breakfast room. What's more, when you are staying at a hotel, you have paid for the buffet, so there is no difference if you eat a muffin and take another to eat later, or if you eat the two muffins directly. </p><p>You know, although I don't think the rules should be obeyed just because they are the rules, I never sneak food into my room. It's not that I'm so law-abiding a person, but I just don't do this. I don't know why."

However, I didn't dare to go and try them on because everyone knows this shop is for people with deep pockets. Once my husband and I were passing by this shop window. He noticed the way I looked at the jeans and asked me whether I wanted to pop in and try them on. I tried to pretend not to be in the mood for shopping, but he insisted and we entered the shop.<p>It was an amazing pair of skinny jeans, the ones you have to fight some to put on, but the torment is forgotten as soon as you see yourself in the mirror. These were dark wash blue jeans with sanding. One might think there was nothing special about them as they were stripped of all details which could justify the price. There were neither zippers nor welts. But they elongated the line of my legs and felt like a second skin. They were perfect because I could match them with anything, be it formal, casual, street style or even corporate. I looked at the price tag, understood they cost a fortune and made my husband quickly leave the shop.</p><p>However, I couldn't help thinking about these jeans. One day I realised that I had to buy them no matter what. Well, I borrowed 500 euros from my friend and couldn't wait to purchase them. Much to my disappointment, when I came to the shop, I was told that the jeans had been sold a few days before. I was upset, but I had to put up with this fact somehow. Gradually I stopped thinking about them.</p> <p>Several weeks later, on my birthday I found a gift box near my bed. Guess what was inside! Those jeans! It was my husband who bought them and prepared a surprise which definitely was a success.  "

It's so large that if you view the city from a tall building, you get the feeling that it doesn't end. X is divided into two parts: the old town and the modern city. </p><p>I'm a keen walker so I explored both of them on foot. And I really liked them both. For example, while walking around its historic part, <u>I leisurely explored historically significant architecture, peaceful green spaces, and unique local attractions along the way</u>. Sometimes <u>I just walked around the city having no destination in mind</u>. While I was walking in the modern part of the city, when I looked up, I felt like I was at the bottom of a deep, man-made canyon. It's really impressive, especially  if you come from a small town, like me. <u>I also visited the  observation deck</u>, which was a bit pricy, but really worth a visit. So <u>I walked, tried local food, visited famous attractions, and even did some shopping</u>. <u>The city is sometimes called ‘a shopper's paradise'</u>, so I didn't want to miss the chance to go to several shopping malls and see for myself. </p><p>I liked X as <u>I was overwhelmed by its size and  beauty</u>. I think <u>it's a magical place</u>. I mean <u>it really did feel like I was jumping from antiquity into modern times</u>.  Also, I can't help saying again that, to my mind, <u> it's the most walkable city of all</u>. <u>You can literally walk for days and still have something new to see</u>. <u>There are countless routes that can be taken in different parts of the city</u>. <u.There are many places of cultural and historic value</u>. So, in my opinion, it's a wonderful place for tourists. And I'd really like to visit it again. "

So it's perfectly natural that she wants to present her new home to her friends, and for this, she's going to throw a housewarming party next month. <p>When I received an invitation, my first thought was 'Oh my God. What gift shall I give her?' To me, choosing the perfect gift is always a daunting task 'cause I hate giving something that will go unappreciated. For me, it's really important to give a gift a person is dreaming of. But the element of surprise is as important as the acceptance of the gift. That's why I never ask a gift-receiver about what they want or need directly. As a result, it usually takes time to find out what a person wants and find the perfect gift for them. </p><p>Fortunately, this time my friend literally saved me when she created a wishlist using Google Docs so that everyone can choose the gift of their choice and budget, but she won't see what people are getting her 'cause she set me as the owner of the spreadsheet. So she has no access to her own document. And we'll be able to keep all activity a secret until she starts unwrapping presents. So nothing will ruin the surprise. What's more, his system helps prevent the receipt of duplicate or unwanted gifts and allows us, gift-givers, to figure out which stores have the items she needs. </p><p>All I did was open the document, look through the whole list and choose the gift I liked the most. And it was also the one that fitted my gift budget. I'm going to buy her a flatware set for 6. It's quite expensive. She told me she'd added some pricey items to the list, but she doesn't expect to get them. Just imagine how surprised and delighted she will be when I give her the gift that she expects the least."

I felt like I was wasting my potential and my career was at a standstill. </p><p>I started looking for other job opportunities, but it was a difficult process. The job market in my field was competitive, and most of the available positions required several years of experience that I didn't have. However, I didn't give up. I continued to search and apply for jobs, and eventually, I received an offer from a smaller company. </p><p>Even though the new job had a lower salary than my previous position, it offered me the opportunity to take on more responsibility and grow professionally.

Once my parents and I were having dinner, when suddenly they told me it was time to start thinking about my future and... (this is where the nightmare began) that they were ready to pay for my education abroad if it was what I really wanted to do. At first, I was on cloud nine, but then I started agonizing over the decision.<p>You can't even imagine how painful the process was. I asked my friends what they would do if they were given such an opportunity. Needless to say, opinions differed wildly. Then I made a list of  pros and cons and analyzed all 'what-ifs' which threw me into doubt all the time. I also read a few articles about education abroad and found out what other students were saying about their experience. I even tried to consider job prospects in different countries.</p><p>I struggled to make a decision because my future was at stake. And, of course, I was afraid to suffer consequences of the wrong choice. It was difficult to imagine what living abroad would be like (taking into account the current situation regarding covid-19). Also, I knew I would have to start my life from the very beginning. And to top it off, I realised I would have to leave my friends and family behind.</p><p>After a great deal of thought I decided to seize this opportunity as it's better to regret what you have done than what you haven't. Now I'm planning to study in Canada.  Of course, the outcomes cannot be accurately predicted yet, but I hope I made the right decision. We'll see. I'm still worried and fear disappointment but at the same time I'm looking forward to this change."

The scene at the station was chaotic - there were crowds of people pushing and shoving, everyone trying to board the same train. Children were crying, their parents trying to calm them down. People were shouting and screaming, desperate to get out of the city before it was too late. As we finally managed to board the train, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief mixed with uncertainty and guilt. The train journey was long and uncomfortable, but we finally reached the border and crossed into a neighboring country. We were lucky enough to have some friends who took us in and helped us settle down.</p><p>As time passed, I realized that I had made the right decision. Several months after we left, our city was hit by a massive missile attack and our house was destroyed.  Looking back on that difficult decision to flee the country, I am grateful for the safety and security we found in a new place. It wasn't an easy journey, but it was necessary to protect my kids and start a new life."

It's an online business model in which you don't keep the products you sell in stock. When you sell a product, a manufacturer, wholesaler, or another retailer ships the product directly to a customer. <p>So for me, it was the easiest way to start my own business. I was told I wouldn't have to stock products, order inventory in bulk, or physically fulfill the orders in any way. But I had to have some capital to launch a website and invest at least a small amount of money in advertising. </p><p>However, the most important thing was to decide which product to sell. And this is what became my biggest problem. I couldn't decide what to sell for too long. I spent a lion's share of time on doing market research to figure out what products or services would be in high demand. And when I was about to start acting, there was an outbreak of coronavirus. Obviously, it wasn't the best time to start a business. So I decided to put my plans on hold.  </p><p>Of course, I felt down for a while, but then I remembered that there's always a second chance. And I'll try again later."

Back then, not so many cars had automatic gearboxes, so learning to drive was more challenging than it is now and required a lot of practice. <p>At first, I decided to take the easy route and asked my father to teach me because he had plenty of experience. But being a good driver doesn’t always mean being a good teacher. He lost his temper and shouted at me every few minutes, which upset both of us. I quickly realized that this wasn’t the best idea. So, I found an instructor who was much more patient than my father - for obvious reasons, actually. He explained what to do and what mistakes to avoid, guiding my every movement. I remember hours and hours of practice, but eventually, I became a confident driver. <p><p>Honestly, it was only when I learned to drive that I truly understood what freedom meant. Even before I had my own car, I could take my parents' vehicle and go somewhere without having to wait for one of them to give me a lift. It often made getting around the city much easier. Now that I have my own car, driving has become an essential skill for me. It saves me a lot of time since I don’t have to wait for a bus, hail a taxi, or depend on someone else for a ride. I can stop or change routes whenever I want, and I’m free to go wherever I need, especially to places that are hard to reach by public transport, like spots out of town. </p><p>What's more, I can take as much stuff as I need without having to keep an eye on it like I would on a bus. No more numb fingers from carrying heavy bags all day. And, I can move large items without needing a transport service. I can genuinely say that learning to drive has improved my life in countless ways."

So, how did it all begin? We met by accident. We went to the same fitness centre and saw each other from time to time, but I didn't pay attention to him as he wasn't my type. Once we had small talk at the reception and after that he befriended me on Facebook. Gradually we started communicating a lot and have become inseparable friends.</p><p>Everybody says we are a perfect match as, on the one hand, we <u>have a lot in common</u>, on the other, we are really different and <u>complement each other</u>, so it is always interesting for us to be together. We both like <u>walking in the park</u>. We can <u>speak on the phone</u> till morning as <u>every hour feels like a minute</u>, and I don't realise how time flies when we are together. We often <u>go to the cinema</u> or just stay at home at <u>watch a good film</u> together. He invites me to different cafes and restaurants where we can taste new dishes and just <u>chat</u>. We <u>discuss our plans for future</u>, visualizing what life will be like when we get married. We like <u>reading books and discussing them</u>. When the weather is bad, we like <u>playing board games such as backgammon or checkers</u> at home.</p><p>Actually, <u>it doesn't really matter what we do as long as we are together</u>. What I know for sure is <u>if it weren't for him, I would have missed out on so many things</u>. For instance, I wouldn't have <u>jumped with a parachute or swum in a cold river</u>. Whatever we do, we always <u>have a good time, laugh and enjoy each other</u>. "

Sometimes I joke that if we got lost on a desert island, we wouldn't get bored for at least 50 years. </p><p>To tell the truth, there just aren't words to describe what my mom means to me. And it cannot be otherwise as we've shared so many things throughout my life. When I was a child, she dropped everything in her schedule to drive me to different clubs and lessons such as singing and dancing. When I felt bad, she would come to my room and ask if I wanted to talk. If I did, she would sit with me until I felt better. And even now whatever happens to me, she is the first person I rush to. I hide nothing from her and talk to her about everything even things that aren't always easy to talk about. She never judges me, no matter what. She is the most important person in my life. "

Without surgeons, many people would suffer and die in pain. For example, someone with appendicitis experiences sharp, unbearable pain, and without surgery, the condition could quickly become fatal. Similarly, a person with a tumor might live with constant, nagging pain that worsens over time. If the tumor isn’t removed, they will continue to suffer both physically and emotionally, unable to lead a normal life. Surgeons relieve this pain, save lives, and give people the chance to recover and heal. And you know, the more skilled and experienced a surgeon is, the better the chances of the patient surviving or recovering from a serious injury. So I think their work is super important for society. <p>I know about this job because my uncle is a surgeon, and I've seen how hard he works to help people. What’s important is that I’ve seen lots of people thank him, which shows his work has a big impact on society. </p><p>In my opinion, to be a surgeon, one has to be very careful and smart. Surgeons need to maintain a high level of concentration for long periods of time. They should also be open to gaining new knowledge and experience to learn better methods for performing operations. Plus, to excel as a surgeon, one must possess impeccable precision, exceptional dexterity, and the ability to remain resilient under immense pressure, as the stakes are often life or death.

One day, we rented two bikes and headed to my friend’s country house. It’s in a really beautiful area near a big forest. And it’s just about an hour’s drive from where I live. The funny thing is, we’d been to the house so many times but only ever had barbecue parties in the garden. We’d never actually explored the nature around it. <p>We packed some food because we weren’t sure if we’d be back quickly or spend the whole day out. We also brought a navigator, just in case we got lost in the middle of nowhere. At first, I was super slow - I was focused on just balancing and steering, so I didn’t really notice the scenery. But it was still fun and kind of reminded me of being a kid again.</p><p>After a while, I got used to it and started riding more confidently. The countryside was amazing. There were cows grazing in the fields, ducks hiding in the grass, and wildflowers everywhere. I stopped a lot to take photos and enjoy the view. The ride wasn’t hard at all. Whenever we got tired, we just walked our bikes and soaked in the peaceful surroundings. </p><p>By evening, we went back to the house and then home. We were tired but happy. Honestly, it was such a refreshing experience. It made me feel like a kid again, bringing back those carefree memories from childhood. Plus, it was a great break from my daily routine. I didn’t think about work or any problems the whole time."

Nowadays, there’s a huge demand for SMM because every company, whether it’s a small startup or a huge, established business, needs to promote itself online. I would even say that if your business doesn’t have an Instagram page these days, it’s like it doesn’t exist. Before this course, I had taken a few similar ones, but I wasn’t very impressed because they were full of general information that didn’t really help. What I wanted were practical, hands-on skills. The course I took was very different. <p>There’s a specialist I follow on Instagram who created this course. It included live lessons on Zoom, where he explained the material, and there were also assignments that were checked by course curators. The course was super practical. I learned how to create posts and run ads for platforms like Instagram and Facebook. I learned how to create an effective content plan. Our teacher shared lots of tips and tricks to help us get more engagement without spending any money. At the end of the course, we had an exam. I received a step-by-step guide with all the information we covered during the course, and I had to create a content plan for my blog for the entire month, write all the posts, pick matching images, and film videos. </p><p>It was awesome. I was simply blown away by the amount of useful resources and materials provided. I’m sure it will help me get my first customers in a heartbeat."

At first, I didn't think it was a good idea because I don't like attending events with lots of people I've never seen before. More importantly, I was pretty sure the host wouldn't be happy to see uninvited guests. I thought that if I were him, I wouldn't be excited. But he insisted, and I finally agreed to go with him. <p>The place, of course, was unusual. It was the first time I'd set foot on a roof for someone's birthday party. I was blown away by the night view of the city. However, as expected, I didn't know anyone there except my friend. There were several trays with drinks and snacks, as well as bean bags where people could rest. </p><p>It was noisy because the music was very loud, and we were screaming and singing. Normally, such gatherings are not my thing, but I enjoyed this one. What I liked the most was that some of the guests, probably the only people there who knew the host and whom the host knew, prepared several unusual ways to congratulate him. For example, they made a video in which each of them gave their wishes to the birthday boy. They also gave him a car-shaped cake, as he had been dreaming of buying a car. They hid other gifts all around the place and made the birthday boy follow clues to find them. It was fun, and it was completely different from all the other birthday parties I had attended before."

I guess it kind of explains how important it is.<p>I'm sure you've seen this plant, at least in pictures. <u>It's a deciduous tree which has tiny leaves</u>. <u>It grows very quickly</u>, <u>even in poor soil</u>. As far as I know, <u>it can grow over 6 metres during the first year</u>. <u>Moringa flowers first bloom when the tree is just 8 months old</u>. <u>These beautiful flowers are creamy white in color, with yellow stamens</u>.  <u>Later they are replaced by long, slender, triangular seed-pods</u>. One more interesting thing about it is that <u>the taste of its  roots resembles that of horseradish</u>.</p><p>It's probably the only tree in the world which can boast of being so useful. I mean <u>every part of the tree has numerous beneficial properties</u>. By far the most important thing is that <u>Moringa leaves contain almost everything the human body needs, which makes a potent weapon against malnutrition</u>. This is because <u>its leaves are loaded with vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids and antioxidants</u>. What's more, <u>they flush out toxins out of the body</u>. <u>Moringa is widely used in herbal medicine because it has anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, cholesterol-lowering, and cardioprotective properties</u>, to name but a few. <u>It stimulates the immune system, therefore it is prescribed for AIDS patients</u>. Also, <u>moringa juice is great for weight loss as it boosts metabolism and burns calories</u>. <u>Its fresh leaves can be used in meals</u>. For example, <u>you can toss them like a salad</u>. <u>You can blend them into smoothies or steam them like spinach</u>. Beside that, <u>moringa is used to produce moringa seed oil, which is an important ingredient in cosmetics</u>. <u>Moringa seeds are more effective for water purification than many of the conventional synthetic materials used nowadays</u>. <u>They can be used for hand washing too</u>.</p><p>Not only is it so useful, but <u>it also tolerates a wide range of soil conditions</u>. <u>Moringa needs much sunlight, warmth, and only some water, therefore it grows well in dry regions as it doesn't require much watering</u>.</p><p>If I lived in the village, I would definitely grow it in the backyard for health purposes.

And his encouragement was particularly important when I was a teenager as it was a critical period in the development of personality.<p>When I was 14, like many teenagers, I did sports and I was dreaming of a career in sports. Once I performed at a national championship which took place just once a year. I had been working hard the whole year to prepare for it. I had a really good chance to become the champion, but I failed to. I was really upset and disappointed. I totally lost my confidence after that failure. What's more, I was so discouraged that I was even going to quit sports.</p><p>My father noticed that I had skipped several trainings. And there was nothing like that before. So I had to tell him what was going on. He sat me down, looked me in the eye and said that if Thomas Edison had given up after his first unsuccessful attempt, we would still have candles instead of electrical bulbs. <u>He told me not to give up no matter what and perceive failures as valuable life lessons rather than disasters 'cause the more ambitious your goal is, the harder it is to achieve it</u>. So it's absolutely normal to face difficulties and failures.</p><p>Well, this talk did wonders. <u>I decided to make one more attempt to win the championship</u>. And I succeeded because <u>my father's encouragement helped me overcome my fear of failure and regain confidence</u>. And I started working hard towards my goal without being afraid</u>. What's important is that now every time I fail to do something on the first try, I recall my father's words and start working even harder."

For example, <u>they say that all your wishes will come true after visiting this place</u>. All you have to do is <u>leave a gift or coin</u> near the statue of X. <u>And there's a fertility statue that a woman should touch if she wants to get pregnant</u>. No one has ever checked it, but... Oh… you won't believe but <u>there are rumours that this place is haunted</u>. But I don't think that someone has ever dared to spend a night there. Also, I can't help mentioning that there is a stunning view from the top. I think it's a great Instagram-worthy photography spot. <u>It's a magical place where every corner is steeped in history</u>.  <u>It's like a journey back in time</u>. In my opinion, <u>it's definitely worth a visit</u>. <p>Despite this, very few tourists visit it because, first of all, <u>it's situated very far from popular tourist destinations</u>. Therefore <u>it's very difficult to get there</u>. I mean <u>it takes almost all day to get to the place, but there's nothing to do there for more than a couple of hours</u>. <u>Many people consider such tours a waste of time</u>. What's more, as I've already said <u>the monastery is situated on top of the mountain</u>. And the worst thing is that <u>there are no roads, just a narrow path</u>. And if it were just narrow, that would be more or less ok. <u>But it is steep and slippery, with loose gravel, sand and mud</u>. So <u>it's a bit dangerous too</u>. <u>Many people think it's not worth risking their lives</u>. And <u>it's necessary  to be in very good shape to be able to climb up there</u>. This means that children, elderly people, most women won't be able to get there. It's only feasible for young people, who are often lazy and don't want to visit places of historic value. So it appears that those who would be interested in visiting this place will have difficulty doing it. Those who could get there aren't really interested. As a result, this place is not popular with tourists. But I believe it deserves much more attention. "

The tour guide recommended me to go to <u>the city's traditional market</u>, which is one of the oldest markets in X, always abuzz with <u>local people and holidaymakers who go there to buy spices, fruit, clothing, souvenirs, handicrafts, fabrics</u>, to name but a few. <p>As I arrived at the market, I was immediately struck by the noise. <u>The market was teeming with people, it was just like a bee hive</u>. There were vendors shouting to attract customers, music playing, and people talking and negotiating prices. </p><p>As I walked through the market, I heard a loud noise and turned to see a vendor using a megaphone. The sound was so loud that it was overwhelming and I could feel a ringing in my ears, like I was at a concert. I tried to get away from the noise as fast as I could, but it seemed to follow me no matter where I went. </p><p>I walked through the rows of stalls, taking in the sights and smells of the fresh produce and handmade crafts. I stopped to chat with some of the vendors and learned about their products and where they were from. I eventually found a stall that sold handmade pottery and decided to buy a small vase as a gift for a friend. The vendor and I negotiated the price, and I paid for the vase using some of the local currency I had exchanged before my trip. </p><p>Overall, I really enjoyed my visit to the noisy market. It was a vibrant, exciting place full of interesting people and products. In my opinion, the noise was sometimes unbearable, but it was definitely a key part of the market's energy and atmosphere. And the sounds of the market were overwhelming at first, but I quickly became accustomed to the noise and began to enjoy the lively atmosphere. Now I can safely say that it's by far the noisiest place I have ever visited."

I follow news, I have my favourite players, but I've never played the game myself. More than that, I've never held a table tennis bat.<p>At first sight, playing this game is as easy as ABC. What you have to do is to hit the ball over the net to hit the other person's side of the table so that they wouldn't return it. Sometimes I also think it's a piece of cake, sometimes I understand it's nowhere near as easy as it seems. So I'm dying to finally learn to play this game in order to understand how difficult or easy it will be and whether I'll be capable of mastering it.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's impossible to play this game wherever and whenever you are as there has to be a special table divided into two halves by a net, a bat consisting of a blade and two rubbers on either side, if you want to play professionally. Also, you need a small plastic ball which can be  either orange or white.</p><p>So after I buy a table tennis bat and a set of balls, I'll be ready to start practising. Thank God, nowadays there are a number of ways to acquire any skills one might want. I already know that the best way to start off is practise bouncing and controlling the ball. There are tons of exercises on the Internet.  And this is what I can do on my own. Next, the odds are that I'll join a local table tennis club and find a coach who will teach me important skills and strategies. Then I'll have to practice a lot until I can do everything without thinking much. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts to excellence.</p><p>I'm sure that I'll benefit from this skill as it's absolutely different from all kinds of sport I've done to date.

And personally I have never regretted going there. It is indeed a miracle garden. <p>We had a good couple of hours wandering around the numerous decorations. <u>There were millions of flowers arranged in colourful arches and patterns</u>.  <u>For example, the hearts passage was totally gorgeous as was the flower covered full size aircraft</u>. <u>Also, there was a huge floral clock made of real plants and flowers</u>. There were giant cats, Disney characters, <u>a flower castle</u>. All of them were totally covered with flowers. <u>You feel like you are in some kind of a fairyland</u>.  </p><p>We took pictures of flowers and flower displays until we both totally ran out of storage space on our phones. Then <u>we just explored the park gasping in amazement every other minute</u>. It's impressive how much work was put in it. If I had to choose one word to describe this amazing place, it would be 'magical'.  It was the first and only time we saw so many colourful flowers. <u>There were colours I never knew existed</u>. <u>It was truly a feast for the eyes</u>. </p><p>I was so impressed that <u>I even set a picture taken there as the home screen on my phone</u>. So <u>every time I unlock my device, I fondly recall my first (and only) visit to this interesting place</u>. "

What's amazing is that whoever comes there instantly feels comfortable too. So I think this is the place I can recommend people to move to. </p><p>In my opinion it's a truly unique place that has its own character and emotional pull. When people generate an image in their heads of what Hong Kong looks like, they envision a concrete jungle. They imagine movies with famous skyscrapers dominating the skyline. Yeah, this is true that <u>there are lots of skyscrapers here</u>. But actually it's the biggest misconception about Hong Kong 'cause <u>almost 65 percent of its territory is parks, beaches, and mountains</u>. And <u>there are lots of amazing hiking trails</u>. I just love that. <u>Plus, there is a lot of busy city life going on here, day and night</u>. It's a wonderful place for young active people like me. </p><p>Some people say that it's great for visiting, but too expensive to live in. In fact<u>Hong Kong IS one of the world's most expensive places to live in</u>. Despite this, <u>it's one of the most heavily populated cities in the world</u>. Nearly 7,5 million people live here. So if almost 8 million people can afford to live there, many other people including me would be able to live there too. </p><p><u>Since the population is very dense, it is very common for apartment buildings to have forty floors and for apartments to be very small</u>. That's probably the only thing that makes me upset, but I'm used to it. I think that this is something people can put up with. "

Other things that matter are <u>accessibility, appearance and amenities</u>, that is <u>the presence of the airport, train and bus stations, good transport links, a number of educational institutions, a wide array of recreational facilities, shopping malls, parks and gardens </u> and, of course, <u>hospitals</u>.

The spaghetti was mushy, the toast was crunchy in the wrong way, and the salad was very plain. But my dad looked so proud of his meal that neither my mom nor I dared to tell him the truth about it.

First and foremost, she's known as a singer. Her music career began almost 20 years ago and since that moment she's released many hit songs and albums. She's won numerous awards for her music, including 9 Grammy Awards. Recently she returned to the stage, after a 6-year break from music, to perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show. I was really happy about it. And rumour has it that next year she's going on tour across the globe to support her upcoming album. By the way, I've heard that she earns around 100 million dollars per concert tour. That's insane. <p>She is not only one of the world's top-earning and popular singers, but also a successful entrepreneur. She's the founder of Fenty Beauty and Savage X Fenty, two successful fashion and beauty brands that have been praised for their wide range of shades and sizes, something that was previously lacking in the industry. </p><p>Rihanna is also a passionate philanthropist. She's been a vocal advocate for social justice causes and has used her platform to raise awareness and funds for various issues, such as education, healthcare, and disaster relief. She's also been an outspoken critic of police brutality and racial injustice. </p><p>Overall, Rihanna is a multi-talented artist and businesswoman who has made a significant impact in the music, fashion, and philanthropy worlds. <u>She's a role model for millions of fans. She inspires people to pursue their passions and make a difference in the world. Her success has shown that hard work, talent, and determination can take you anywhere you want to go.</u>"

Bea makes videos and writes about her own life, experiences, interests, or daily activities, for example, there's content about subjects like parenting, cooking, fitness, beauty, college life, home decoration and everything else in between. <p>You know, there are millions of lifestyle bloggers all over the world, so it's almost impossible to create content somebody else hasn't shared yet, but she's really popular. And I think that it is being authentic that helps her stand out from the crowd. Now many bloggers show only carefully curated, beautifully lit and perfectly filtered moments and think that this will help them connect with followers, but I think this strategy doesn't work. And she doesn't use it. She managed to find her 'blend' of content. It's obvious that she enjoys blogging. I'm sure this helps her keep her social media presence real. And this content resonates with many people. For example, in her opinion, sometimes it's okay to post without a filter, or even post about challenges and struggles. I really appreciate that. </p><p>And I am honestly impressed by her ability to create a personal brand, build an audience and develop influence, open up to strangers, and stay popular for so long given the fact that a niche of lifestyle blogging is over-saturated nowadays. I'm sure it's because she has never tried to be just like other successful lifestyle bloggers. That's why I enjoy reading her posts and watching her videos on YouTube. "

But during the COVID pandemic, I got so bored staying at home that I decided to take a virtual tour of <u>Notre-Dame de Paris</u>. So now, I can say that I've been there. <u>This is a medieval Gothic building</u> which has become <u>a truly iconic landmark</u>. I'm sure there are no people in the world, except newborn babies, of course, who have never heard of and cannot recognise this cathedral. <u>It is one of the most visited museums not only in France, but in the entire world</u>. <p>What makes an immediate impression on visitors to Notre Dame is, with doubt, its immense size. </p><p>The second striking thing is its beauty. You can't but gasp in amazement when you, first, see its <u>three big portals laden with sculpted saints and sacred scenes</u>. Then your jaw drops when you see <u>two massive Gothic towers which crown the facade</u>. At first glance, they seem identical twins, but they aren't. The north tower is, in fact, bigger than the south one. </p><p>At the cathedral's east end, <u>there's the apse with large clerestory windows</u>. <u>It is crowned with an infamous Gothic spire which recently collapsed in the fire</u>. <u>There are also many exterior flying buttresses constructed to support thin walls</u>. </p></p>If you look at the cathedral either side, <u>you'll see porches, chapels and other embellishments</u>. Oh, and I forgot to mention its <u>three great rose windows which have retained their thirteenth century glass</u>. </p><p>So, Notre Dame is, undoubtedly, an architectural masterpiece, but not just that. Also, <u>it's a Catholic place of worship, and it's a functioning church</u>. <u>People can meet a priest to receive the forgiveness of sins or attend masses and services almost every day</u>. "

On average, each item costs twice as much as similar ones in Tesco or in any other popular chain store. This shop supports fair trade, which means it supports local farmers and offers them fair prices. I mean, unlike big chains that pay farmers very little, this shop ensures farmers get enough money to live well. Because of this, the prices in the shop are higher. <p>And, by the way, that’s one of the reasons why I go there every week. I like the idea that people will get paid decently for the efforts they have put in. I’m 100 percent sure that the better people are paid, the harder they will work. You know, if a person gets paid well, they will feel happy doing their work, and this energy will influence the products produced. I want to consume positive energy rather than the energy of the sufferings of people who worked hard, gained little, and hated what they did. </p><p>The shop is small and cozy. It’s well laid out. It's never crowded, even during peak hours. This makes shopping a more pleasant experience. The staff are friendly and always ready to help. It sells fruits and vegetables, delicious homemade bread, and many organic products. For example, the household chemicals and soap are all made from organic materials, which is good because they are better for the environment and safer for our health. Also, the quality of the products is very high. For instance, the fruits are never rotten or dirty. </p><p>Last time I bought quite a lot there, more than usual. I got flour, mince, grapes, apples, tomatoes, peppers, and eggs. I also got a big block of cheese. Plus, I bought five kilos of potatoes and some frozen sweetcorn. I managed to stock up on sweet treats for the kids, too; they absolutely love the cookies I buy there. Finally, I needed some hand wash, so I bought that as well. <br>"

However, I’d like to clarify that most of the time, she tries to find bargains rather than just cheap things. She only occasionally shops super cheaply, mainly for household items such as cleaning supplies, toiletries, paper products, and kitchen essentials, as well as fashion pieces that go out of style quickly and clothes for kids because they quickly outgrow them. <p>In all other cases, she focuses on value rather than just cost. She buys whatever she needs or wants for herself, her family, or her friends, but she plans her shopping much more carefully than most people. She plans her shopping around sales events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and seasonal clearances. And she often has to wait to buy until there's a significant discount. Plus, she spends a lot of time researching, comparing prices, and reading reviews to get the best deal. </p><p>Mary never buys goods from new collections. When stores have sales, some items are 70 percent off. It’s crazy, but she seems to know the schedule of each store's sales. What’s more, she knows about literally all the special offers in every shop. She likes to buy pre-owned designer bags and shoes. Also, she loves items that are discounted due to their imperfections. For example, if a bag has a scratch on it, the shop will give a very big discount even if the scratch is hardly visible. When such offers appear, Mary pops up out of nowhere and she’s the first person to get it. </p><p>She always looks for the best quality products at the lowest prices, but it’s not because she’s stingy. She just tries to spend her family’s money in the most effective way and get everything she needs and wants within budget. She has a very large family, and if she didn't find discounted prices, she would need to marry a millionaire to afford enough of everything for everyone."

And, you know, what I thought would be a nightmarish experience turned out to be incredibly enjoyable. Normally, I travel around the city by car, but my car broke down on that very day. It just didn't start. But I wanted to spend quality time with my best friend, and we haven't seen each other very often lately. So we decided not to postpone our get-together until later. <p>According to our initial plan, I had to pick her up, and we were supposed to go to the park together in my car. But since the car broke down and we had to use public transport, we decided to travel separately and meet at the park. If I had taken the bus to her place and then we had gone to the park together, it would have taken ages.</p><p>I expected the bus to be super crowded. I have no clue what happened, but there were hardly any people there, even though it was a Sunday during that busy period when many people go out for leisure activities or shopping. But I remember it was super hot that day, and maybe this is what made people stay home. Since it wasn't as crowded as usual, I had plenty of space. I could choose where I wanted to sit, and there were a lot of options. I was very glad about this because the ride to the park takes more than an hour, and standing for that long is difficult. </p><p>During the trip, I read a book because I usually don't have any time for reading on regular days. When I finished the book, I just looked out the window and enjoyed the scenery."

In a 'what-cleft' sentence, the clause beginning with 'what' functions as the subject of the sentence and the rest of the sentence provides information about this subject. Here, the clause 'What I thought would be a nightmarish experience' is the subject, and 'turned out to be incredibly enjoyable' is the predicate that gives more information about the subject. This structure helps to emphasize the contrast between the expectation and the reality. Additionally, there is a sequence of tenses in the sentence. 'I thought' is in the past tense, indicating the speaker's belief at a specific time in the past. 'Would be' is the past form of 'will be,' used here because of the past tense in the main clause ('I thought'). This is part of the reported speech. The sequence of tenses ensures that the tenses used in the subordinate clause (the 'what' clause) match the tense in the main clause."

It was a special occasion because the party was at a nice restaurant, so I wanted to look as smart as I could. I wasn’t trying to impress anyone or draw too much attention to myself, but I knew it was important to dress appropriately for the event.<p>I decided to wear my favorite shirt. It’s a blue striped shirt. At first glance, it might not seem like anything special, but it’s actually a branded shirt. The brand isn’t flashy, and there are no big labels that stand out, but when I wear it, I feel like I’m a model from a magazine cover. I feel like a celebrity, really. </p><p>I also put on my new pair of jeans. I don’t usually wear this outfit because I don’t want it to get worn out or look shabby too quickly. I save this shirt and these jeans for events like this, where I want to look especially stylish. So when I arrived at the restaurant, I felt confident and comfortable in my outfit. I think it was the perfect choice for the occasion."

It survived the first fall with only minor damage, but the second one appeared to be almost fatal. At first glance, it looks normal. However, if you look closely, you see that the glass face shattered, but the lines are so thin that they can't be seen with the naked eye. Therefore people roll their eyes as I tell them <u>I want to replace my phone</u>. Well, sometimes everything works well, but sometimes, at the worst possible time, <u>the touchscreen stops responding to the touch gestures</u>. And that makes me mad. </p><p>Another reason is that my phone's battery is on its last legs. It dies halfway through the day and I constantly have to recharge it. Again, it dies when I need it the most. </p><p>But, to be honest, even if everything was fine, I would like to upgrade to some new model because new models usually come with increasingly advanced and cool features. </p><p><u>I want to consider several options before I make up my mind</u>. Now I'm thinking of Samsung Galaxy S23. It's super expensive. And that's the only reason why I can't buy it right now.  In January, Samsung released its latest model, the Galaxy S24. And this means that the price for S23 will inevitable fall. <u>I just have to wait a little until the price drops and, while waiting, I have to set aside some money each month</u>. "

Now, she is not only my best friend but also my colleague and neighbour. We look so much alike that some people even think we are sisters. <p>When I was 10, I attended dancing classes. I always showed up early and always saw a girl who was already there no matter how early I came. We usually waited for our class to start in the locker room, pretending to be glued to our phones not noticing one another.  Once I decided to start a conversation. This was my best decision ever. After that we often made small talk. Some weeks later we exchanged telephone numbers and started calling and texting each other from time to time. It turned out we had a lot in common, and I really enjoyed talking to her. We communicated more and more frequently, went to the park and to the cinema. It was inevitable that we became best friends. And since that time we've been inseparable.</p><p>To be honest, it doesn't really matter what we do as long as we are together. I've noticed recently that the older we get, the more we like to just sit around and talk instead of hanging around the city all day. In the summer, we like travelling together.</p><p>It is without doubt she is the person really worth having by your side. I know she will support me no matter what. She knows all my secrets and I know hers. When times are hard, she is the first person I want to talk to in order to get problems off my chest. When everything's ok, we just enjoy each other's company.  So when people ask me whether we are sisters, I always say they are mistaken as we are closer than sisters.</p>"

And there’s always a new backdrop for photos. In spring, there are colorful tulips, in summer, bright sunflowers, and in autumn, beautiful orange and red leaves. Every season is special in its own way. So <u>I never run out of photos for my Instagram feed</u>. </p><p>But my favorite part of the park is a spot on a hill. From there, you can see the sunset, and it's always such a breathtaking view. My friends and I usually take photos with the sunset in the background, and sometimes we just capture the sunset itself. The colors are so bright and natural, from soft pinks and oranges to deep purples and reds. One of my favorite sunset photos is actually the wallpaper on my phone right now. <u>If you saw it, you’d be blown away</u>. These photos don’t even need filters or editing - they’re already perfect just as they are. That’s why I love coming back to the park, again and again, to capture those beautiful moments.<br>"

And we, adults, do it automatically without thinking about it. I mean it's as natural as breathing. So I thought I would show it once or perhaps twice and it would be done, but sometimes things don't go like we think they will. This was just the case. He couldn't repeat after me. So it turned out to be one of the biggest challenges in my whole life.<p>My mom told me that <u>this process could take up to a month of consistency and dedication from both the teacher and child (and a lot of patience)</u>. </p><p>I understood that, first of all, <u>I myself had to learn how to teach somebody</u>. So, <u>I watched a number of video tutorials which showed different ways to teach a child to tie shoelaces</u>. After that <u>we started practising 5 minutes every day, and I broke down this complicated task into smaller steps in order not to overwhelm the child</u>. </p><p>At first, <u>we practised with his shoes off</u>. <u>I used laces of two different colours to help him differentiate one lace from the other</u>.  <u>We started from learning to make a starting knot</u>. <u>I showed him how to cross the left end of the lace over the right one, then wrap one end around the other, and pull both ends to complete the knot</u>. <p><p>When he finally succeeded, we moved on to a more complicated task. <u>I started teaching him to make both ends into 'loops' that look like bunny ears, and then repeat all those steps that I've already described</u>. Every day we took one small step forward. </p><p>Everything was ok when we did it together, but when I asked him to do it himself, it was terrible. It was as if he had never practised anything before. Several times I was on the verge of losing my temper. But I didn't give up. It was a challenge for me. I wanted to see what I was capable of as a teacher.  When it all was over and he managed to tie his first shoelaces singlehandedly, <u>I had a sense of satisfaction and relief</u>. "

For this reason, I remember all those 2 or 3 cases when I didn't delete a picture taken by another person. <p>I think I'll describe one close-up which drew the most likes and comments on Facebook and Instagram recently. It sounds silly to care about something as small as a like on a picture, but it's our reality. To tell the truth, I didn't expect that photo to break the Internet but it did.</p><p>Several weeks ago I came home after my friend's birthday party. I had a very beautiful makeup. Dark smoky eyes and glossy lips… I decided such heavenly beauty had to be captured forever, so I took my selfie stick and started experimenting. But I didn't like the pics. My mom wanted me to help her about the house, so she decided to speed up the process and help me get a beautiful picture. </p><p>She took pictures at eye level and from a higher angle to exaggerate the size of my eyes and avoid a double chin in a picture. She took hundreds of them as my pictures never come out perfect after the first snapshot. Then we picked the best one, I used some filters to manipulate the image, you know, to erase blemishes…such things. After that I cropped the image so that nobody could see the background and immediately uploaded it to Facebook and Instagram, awaiting for likes and comments.</p><p>Frankly speaking, I really liked the way I looked because I was genuinely happy in the picture and looked simply amazing on that day. So, probably,  even if my friends hadn't liked this pic so much, it would, anyway, be one of my favourite ones.</p>"

I dropped so many hints that he finally understood that I wanted him to buy it for me. <u>He promised to give it to me as a birthday gift</u> and, voila, soon I became the owner of Apple Watch Sport (a Samsung smart watch). <u>I was more than happy even though it wasn't a surprise gift</u>. </p><p>Now I can't imagine my life without this device. It is just as cool as it sounds. Its greatest feature is <u>receiving notifications</u>. <u>I no longer have to dig my phone out of my bag to determine if the notification is important or I can deal with it later</u>. All I need is just a quick glance at my wrist. So now <u>I can stay informed without interrupting activities with real people</u>, for example, at a business meeting. Plus, <u>I no longer distract viewers in a movie theater with a bright smartphone screen to see who just sent me a text</u>. <u>It's also really helpful when my smartphone isn't easily accessible</u>. Say, I'm cooking or driving…  I turn my watch to face me and say: 'Hey Siri, do this or that.' <u>I answer many calls in the car and have perfectly normal conversations even with both hands on the wheel</u>. <u>The microphone works shockingly well</u>. Also, I would often not feel my iPhone vibrate from my pocket, so I had to periodically check my iPhone. With Watch, I never miss the tap on the wrist."

But the only type of music he listens to is classical. One day, I asked Jack why he never listens to pop, rock, or any other genres. He said something like, ‘Classical music is like fine wine. It has depth, richness, and complexity that you just can't find anywhere else. Plus, it's the only music that has those special vibrations that really make a difference.’ <p>He says that the vibrations from this type of music make people feel better and even help them live better. Once he mentioned a study showing classical music can lower stress, improve focus, and even boost the immune system. So, he’s convinced that no other type of music has this power. </p><p>Whenever we meet, Jack shares interesting facts about classical music. He knows a lot about famous composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach. We actually listen to this music together. As I've said before, he listens to classical music literally all the time. I'm not exaggerating.</p><p>On the one hand, Jack's passion for music is truly inspiring. He's shown me that music can be more than just entertainment - it's a powerful force that enhances our lives and well-being. But on the other hand, it can be really annoying, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes, I just want to have a quiet conversation without music in the background."

Many people may say that coffee shops are busy, noisy places where you can barely hear yourself think, but  they are not so noisy as everyone thinks. At least, when I was there, I could easily focus on what I was  reading or writing, and, funnily enough, there were a lot fewer distractions than at home, for example. <p>To tell the truth, I didn't like studying in a quiet room and I needed a little more noise and ambience. So I went there almost every day after classes even when I didn't have to get together with my classmates. Thank God, my parents gave me enough pocket money, so I could afford to spend some time there. I went there to do research on different topics, prepare presentations, solve problem sets in Physics, Chemistry and Maths, do project assignments for various courses, review notes from lectures, read the assigned texts. The only thing that I couldn't do there was writing essays. This was the only activity that I preferred doing in a quiet room.</p><p> The main reason why that environment suited me perfectly were that, first of all, I liked to eat and drink while studying. It kind of helped me be more productive. I could have delicious coffee with some food. When I studied at home, I had to cook myself. That made me take breaks very frequently. As a result, I had to interrupt my studying process. And the problem about it was that once I got distracted, it took about 20 minutes to return to the original task no matter how hard or easy the task was. Secondly, I could use wifi for free, which was very important doing research. Finally, this place was great for group study sessions. I remember we had to complete group assignments almost every week, and inviting so many people to my place was out of question. My parents didn't like when someone was making too much noise at home."

I follow news, I have my favourite players, but I've never played the game myself. More than that, I've never held a table tennis bat.<p>At first sight, playing this game is as easy as ABC. What you have to do is to hit the ball over the net to hit the other person's side of the table so that they wouldn't return it. Sometimes I also think it's a piece of cake, sometimes I understand it's nowhere near as easy as it seems. So I'm dying to finally learn to play this game in order to understand how difficult or easy it will be and whether I'll be capable of mastering it.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's impossible to play this game wherever and whenever you are as there has to be a special table divided into two halves by a net, a bat consisting of a blade and two rubbers on either side, if you want to play professionally. Also, you need a small plastic ball which can be  either orange or white.</p><p>So after I buy a table tennis bat and a set of balls, I'll be ready to start practising. Thank God, nowadays there are a number of ways to acquire any skills one might want. I already know that the best way to start off is practise bouncing and controlling the ball. There are tons of exercises on the Internet.  And this is what I can do on my own. Next, the odds are that I'll join a local table tennis club and find a coach who will teach me important skills and strategies. Then I'll have to practice a lot until I can do everything without thinking much. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts to excellence.</p><p>I'm sure that I'll benefit from this skill as it's absolutely different from all kinds of sport I've done to date. Besides, it is said to significantly improve eyesight and reaction. And I have to confess, I really want to beat my friend who keeps saying that all I can do is watch matches on TV.</p>"

Of course, my friends thought there was nothing fun about giving cash. Moreover, they understood that they wouldn't be able to give me enough money to consider this computer their birthday present. They joked they would buy one tenth of a computer for me. They weren't as excited about it as I was, so they decided that if they couldn't afford to buy a computer, they would, at least, find some creative way to give cash so that I would remember it for a long time. They gave me a huge bouquet of flowers that were made from banknotes. They folded banknotes so that they resembled buds.</p><p>To be honest, I thought they would give me a white boring envelope with cash. Can you imagine how surprised I was when I saw this bouquet. <u>My jaw dropped in amazement</u>. I'm not joking. They managed to kill two birds with one stone. First of all, they gave me what I really needed. At the same time, I was pleasantly surprised as I didn't expect cash to be so creative a gift. So money appeared to be one of the most memorable gifts in my life."

It's not just a luxury feature, it's actually important for my overall health and well-being. Stretching my legs while sitting can help improve circulation and prevent blood clots from forming. And it has an adjustable backrest that allows me to recline to the perfect angle and ease the tension in my lower back and hips, which can become sore after sitting for long periods of time. Plus, it's right next to a window that allows a good amount of natural light to come in, so I can enjoy the sun while I'm relaxing. <p>I spend a lot of time in that chair. It's the perfect spot to curl up with a good book or catch up on my favorite TV shows. It's also where I go to work sometimes, but honestly, it's so comfortable that I usually end up taking a nap instead. </p><p>So, my beloved recliner chair is the most comfortable and cozy place to relax in my living room.

At first, I wanted to find a suitable one online, but I was overwhelmed by the number of options available. In the end, I decided to go to a reputable electronics store as I wasn't ready to throw money away and buy the first thing I saw online. So I went to the store. <p>The shop assistant listened to me really carefully and quickly helped find the right solution for my individual needs, not just sold me something because that ‘something' would pay him more. Unfortunately, the laptop I'd chosen appeared to be out of stock, so he said he would contact other branches to find the model I wanted. He said this would take a day or two. Of course, I agreed to wait a bit. I asked the shop assistant to keep me updated in order to understand whether I would get the laptop or have to find it elsewhere.</p><p>However, <u>I had been kept totally in the dark about what the situation was like for about a week</u> until I contacted the shop's customer support service myself and complained about it. </p><p>A customer service manager listened to me very carefully. Then <u>she sincerely apologized for the trouble I had to experience with the company and promised to deal with this issue as quickly as humanly possible</u>.  The manager called me back within 30 minutes and told me about what had happened. She promised I would get my order the following day. I did get it. Also, <u>the company offered me a big discount</u>, which was very nice. </p><p>Several days later she called me again to make sure everything was ok. This way, she let me know that she hadn't forgotten about me. It may not sound like much, but it really made me feel valued as a customer. And I really appreciated that."

To be honest, right now <u>the word 'settle' puts me into a cold sweat</u>. <u>I'm still searching for a perfect place to live, work and raise a family</u>. <u>And because of this, I want to travel and see different parts of the world before I find a place I will be willing to connect to</u>. Who knows? In the end, after having tried out a number of options, I might want to return to Barcelona and put down roots there 'cause it really is one the best places I've ever been to. <p><u>it's is a huge and bustling city, which I like a lot</u>. There's always so much to do and see. I mean It's so large that if you view the city from a tall building, you get the feeling that it doesn't end. At the same time, it's compact. You know, I don't want to feel like a pebble of sand in the big ocean. So the fact that it's nowhere near as big as New York appeals to me greatly. Plus, it's the most walkable city of all. You can literally walk for days and still have something new to see. And I'm a keen walker. So <u>I will walk, try local food, visit famous attractions, do some shopping, and explore job opportunities</u>. "

And at some point, we realised that all of us wanted to do something more entertaining than just sitting around and chatting. One of my friends suggested trying <u>an escape room</u>, you know, a game in which a team of people is locked in a room. <u>And they must find clues and solve puzzles to complete a given mission and find the key to escape</u>. I GOT SUPER PSYCHED ABOUT THE IDEA 'cause it was something I hadn't done before. We did a quick online search for escape rooms in that area and chose the one that had lots of good customer reviews. <p>There were 4 of us. We were kind of spies who broke into someone's house to find some secret files. Frankly speaking, I don't remember the storyline in detail, but I remember that we had one hour to escape the room to avoid being caught and imprisoned.</p><p>The room, in which we were locked, was packed with different stuff such as books, maps, fedoras, magnets, sticky notes, watches, old wigs, compasses, lamps, board games, playing cards. We were frantically searching for clues. Some of them involved solving riddles, putting items in the correct order, or finding a set of objects hidden in the room. <u>The puzzles were really challenging</u>. </p><p><u>And it was real fun</u>. What I will never forget is that there was a broken clock, and for a long time we couldn't figure out that we had to pay attention to the time it stopped on. By the way, it appeared to be the last clue. </p><p>It was completely different from what we usually do together. And to tell the truth, I didn't expect it to be so exciting. "

One day we rented two bikes and went to my friend's country house that is located in a very picturesque area near the coniferous forest. Funnily enough, we only had barbeque parties in the garden there and had never explored the beautiful nature around. <p>We took some food because we didn't know if we would return fast or spend the whole day. We took a navigator not to get lost somewhere in the middle of nowhere. At first, I was riding at a snail's pace. I was concentrating solely on balancing and steering, and, of course, I didn't look around and couldn't appreciate the beautiful scenery. But it was fun. It was a bit like being a kid again. I soon got the hang of it and started riding confidently. There were cows grazing in green fields, ducks hiding in the grass, beautiful wild flowers, and butterflies. I often stopped to take photos and just enjoy the stunning scenery. In general, it wasn't a strenuous tour. Whenever we felt tired, we just wheeled our bikes and enjoyed the scenery. In the evening, we returned to our starting point and went home. </p><p>We were tired physically, but it helped me to recharge my batteries, and it was really fun. It's difficult to describe in words what exactly made this experience so joyful. I guess, first of all, it brought back the uncomplicated, carefree pleasures of youth and conjured happy memories of childhood, as it is then that most of us first discover the delights of the bicycle. Also, it was an escape from my daily routine, and I stopped thinking about my work and problems. And, you know, I really like outdoor activities and nature. However, I don't go to the countryside as often as I'd like to."

Wednesday is a member of the Addams Family, a fictional family created by American cartoonist Charles Addams. She is known for her dark personality and macabre interests, and is often depicted as being intelligent, independent, and mischievous. She's got this super distinct look with long black hair, pale skin, and all black clothes. Basically, she's a total icon and everyone loves her. <p>When I was a kid, I absolutely loved the Addams Family movies with Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. Christina Ricci's performance as Wednesday Addams was so special to me that I didn't want to risk having that memory tarnished by watching the Netflix version. So when Netflix's Wednesday starring Jenna Ortega was released, I decided not to watch it because I didn't want to see anyone other than Christina Ricci take on the role. So it wasn't until the Wednesday dance took over Tiktok that I became interested in watching the series. I'm glad I did - it was a lot of fun (actually, I binge-watched it). </p</p>Now I can say that both actresses did a great job of bringing Wednesday's unique personality and character to life on screen. But Jenna Ortega's performance as Wednesday Addams is, in my opinion, the best interpretation of the character we have seen so far. <p><p>There are so many reasons why I love Wednesday Addams as a movie character. For one, she has a keen eye for seeing what's really going on beneath the surface of people's actions. If only I could also have this ability. So she's not easily fooled and is always quick to see through any attempts to deceive her. Wednesday is also incredibly smart and always speaks her mind, never afraid to stand up for herself or what she believes in. She's a symbol of counterculture and nonconformity, and I admire  her unique, unconventional personality and her ability to remain true to herself. Her iconic style only adds to her appeal as a character. Wednesday Addams is truly one of a kind."

And although the right moment hasn't come yet, this is what I still really want to learn to do.<p>First of all, it would be beneficial for my business as I need to create posters, leaflet designs or images for my Facebook page and website almost every day. And it is very important for these images to be simple, yet, attractive and  informative. Sometimes I can make them myself if I just need to crop or resize the image using Microsoft Paint. However, when I need some more advanced manipulations, I have to hire a designer. Unfortunately, I'm sure that in most cases it would be much faster to do it myself than to explain a designer what idea I have in my head. Also, I love taking pictures and being taken pictures of. These photos never come out perfect after the first snapshot, therefore I usually take hundreds of them before I feel satisfied with the result. If only I could use Photoshop, I think I would have to take half as many.</p><p>This software has a reputation for being hard to learn but, thank God, there are a number of online courses and video tutorials to practice along with. So even though I usually work long hours and often have to go to work at weekends, I'll be able to master this skill at home and learn at my own pace whenever I have a spare moment. If it appears as difficult as it seems, one day I'll find the time to take an extensive course at a local occupational school.</p><p>I don't think I'll ever regret as this is the skill that will pay off forever. Moreover, it's always interesting to try something new. You know, it's a nice way to relieve the stress when you do what is not a part of your daily routine."

When I was a kid, I'd beg my parents to buy me the latest and greatest titles, and I'd spend hours on end lost in virtual worlds. My friends and I would have marathon gaming sessions on the weekends, trying to beat each other's high scores and bragging about our achievements. <p>I think part of the reason I enjoyed video games so much was because they allowed me to escape from reality. When I was playing a game, I could be anyone or do anything. I could be a hero saving the world from an alien invasion, or a professional athlete competing in the biggest sporting event of the year. It was a way for me to let my imagination run wild and experience things I could never do in real life.</p><p>As I grew older, my love of video games only intensified. I saved up my allowance and birthday money to buy every new console that came out, and I spent countless hours exploring every nook and cranny of my favorite games. I even started competing in online tournaments, trying to prove that I was the best in the world at my favorite titles. </p><p>Now that I'm 24, I still love video games just as much as I did when I was a kid. I may not have as much time to play as I used to, but I still make sure to carve out a few hours every week to indulge in my favorite hobby."

I was always the one who was the most strategic, carefully calculating my moves and trying to outmaneuver my opponents. <p>One of the things I loved most about Monopoly was the feeling of excitement I got when I landed on a property I wanted to buy. My heart would race as I counted out my money, praying that I had enough to make the purchase. And when I finally got my hands on a prime piece of real estate, I'd do a little victory dance around the board. </p><p>Looking back, I realize that playing Monopoly taught me a lot of valuable skills that have served me well in my adult life. It helped me learn about money management, for one thing. I had to budget my cash carefully and make smart investments if I wanted to come out ahead. It also taught me how to think ahead and plan for the future, as I had to anticipate what my opponents were going to do and come up with a counter strategy.</p><p>As I grew older, my love of Monopoly never waned. I'd still play with my siblings when I was home from college, and we'd have marathon sessions that lasted for hours. It was such a fun and nostalgicically comforting way to spend an afternoon. </p><p>Even now, as an adult, I still love playing Monopoly. It's one of those games that never gets old, and I'm always up for a round if anyone is game."

This is a word guessing game in which players should think up a charade, a secret word, for a volunteer from the opposite team . Then this player has to act out the word to communicate its meaning to the other members of the team. And, of course, whoever guesses the most words wins the game.<p>My friends and I used to play Charades a lot. The game was our first choice when we had to stay indoors if it was raining. Also, I'm sure our birthday parties wouldn't have been so exciting if it hadn't been for it. Needless to say, this was our favourite way to pass time during the breaks between lessons and after school. We used to gather at someone's place and play for hours.</p><p>I remember that, at first, we didn't have to be really inventive to make challenging tasks for each other. In fact, any word would do the job. We laughed a lot as it was real fun seeing a person going mental to explain the word. The more we played, the more sophisticated our charades became. We started choosing abstract notions which were difficult to explain. For instance, something like eternity or justice was like a death sentence for those who had to act out the words, but it was a whole different story for the rest of us. We were splitting our sides laughing, while those poor things were struggling to show the word. Also, we deliberately tried to think up the word which would make a person look weird and perform strange gestures. </p><p>I guess I was always the one who was the most enthusiastic about acting out the clues, whether it was pretending to be an animal, a famous person, or a movie title. There's no denying that I played charades for the sheer joy of it and to bond with my friends. But I can't help admitting that I also relished the chance to show off my clever side. As an avid reader, I was often able to guess the words faster than anyone else, which made everyone want me on their team. It was a nice ego boost, to be honest."

So everyone knows that inviting me to a good restaurant is a perfect way to please me. <p>One day my boyfriend invited me to eat out. It was our <u>dating anniversary</u> so I understood we wouldn't go to MacDonald's. But I couldn't even imagine that he would invite me to <u>the most expensive restaurant in our city</u>. I was blown away when he told me where we were going to have dinner. I got an opportunity to try some exclusive super expensive dishes that I only heard about and saw in pictures. </p><p>I really wanted to try <u>oysters</u> as there were so many people who loved them and the same number of people who hated them. So, on the one hand,  I wanted to form my own opinion about this type of seafood. On the other, I was a bit afraid. We ordered <u>a large plate of oysters with very dry white wine</u>. Although they were expensive, I thought there wouldn't be a better chance in the near future, so I was determined to taste them come what may.</p><p>My boyfriend  started eating them, saying every other second how <u>delicious</u> they were. I plucked up my courage, took the first oyster and slurped it before I had a change of heart. I liked it. You know <u>if they hadn't been so expensive, I would have eaten three times as much</u>. Now I understand why they are considered a culinary delicacy</u>. I also persuaded my boyfriend to try <u>fuagra</u> and some other sophisticated dishes. <u>This really was a gastronomic delight.</u> </p><p>This dinner was special because, first of all, I felt special and loved. Also, <u>I had never tried so many culinary delicacies during one meal</u>. It was easily the best meal in my life. <u>The food was so delicious that I thought I had died and gone to heaven</u>. "

I have to confess... I used to be a very lazy girl who loved fast food and hated sports. And at that time I was so slim that I didn't even think that one day being overweight would become my number 1 problem. So when I realised that I'd put on X kilos, I decided to lose weight and get fit, no matter what. <p>And so it began. <u>I started I exercising  daily</u>. <u>I went  jogging in the mornings and I walked in the evenings</u>. Also, <u>I ditched junk food and stopped buying snacks</u>, which I couldn't live without. <u>I started sticking to a diet</u>. You know, no sweets, no rice, no cheeseburgers and French fries. Nothing. Only salads, vegetables, fruits and plenty of fluids. <u>I ate only healthy food and drank a lot of water daily</u>. <u>I cooked foods in healthier ways such as boiling, baking and stewing</u>. I read somewhere that it is better to have a few light meals instead of one main meal. So I followed this advice too. I continued this practice for six straight months. As a result, I lost more than X kilograms. </p><p>Now I'm not only as slim as I used to be, but I'm also fit enough. And I'm genuinely proud of my achievement. I should say <u>it was hard to change my habits, my diet and my lifestyle, and at some point I was about to give up because all those activities were really time consuming</u>. But <u>I didn't, thank God, though I was facing a lot of difficulties</u>. Another thing that makes me feel inordinately proud of myself is that <u>I achieved great results without anybody's help</u>. <u>I just read blogs and forums, used a lot of online resources</u>, but it was I that decided what to do with myself. <u>This is something I never thought I could do</u>. <u>You can't even imagine how much effort I put in achieving this result</u>. <u>I would even say I was fighting the battle of my life</u>. And I won."

I really wanted to taste them as there were so many people who loved them and the same number of people who hated them. So, on the one hand,  I wanted to form my own opinion on this type of seafood. On the other, I was a bit afraid. The place we stayed in was right by the sea, so my friends persuaded me this was the best opportunity to duly appreciate the taste of oysters as they were supposed to be really fresh there.<p>We went to <u>a seafood restaurant</u> and ordered a large plate of oysters. Although they were expensive, I thought there wouldn't be a better chance in the near future, so I was determined to taste them come what may.</p><p>My friends started eating, saying every other second how <u>delicious</u> they were. I plucked up my courage, took the first oyster and slurped it before I changed my mind.</p><p>When my mouth was filled with slime, I had to swallow this slippery liquid just because there were many people around. But <u>if I had been at home, I would have spitted it out immediately as the texture was just horrible</u>. Needless to say, <u>they didn't meet my expectations and  I couldn't understand why many people consider them a culinary delicacy</u>. To be honest, even <u>if I had been paid, I wouldn't have eaten all of them</u>.  But on the bright side, at least now I can say ‘I've done it'. "

The only recent development that made my life much easier is <u>a hypermarket</u> that opened several months ago.<p>Actually, there is one more big-box store in my city, the one where I used to do all my shopping, but it is situated on the other end of the city, so it took me way too much time to get there and back. This one is also located <u>on the outskirts of the city</u>, but it's much closer to my home, which is really convenient and saves a lot of my time. The only thing that makes me upset is that it occupies the territory which used to be a football field.</p><p>Like all hypermarkets, <u>it sells a lot of different types of goods from toothpaste to household appliances and provides consumers with all the goods they require, under one roof</u>. What I particularly like is that <u>it has a huge variety of products that I just haven't seen anywhere else</u>. At the same time, <u>whatever I find there is going to be affordable</u>. <u>I recently got a T-shirt  for $2 where I would have paid more than $5 elsewhere</u>. I also have big savings on  products that I buy in bulk, for example, bottled water, kitchen paper, washing powder and many other things like these. Also, <u>product categories are well organised so that I can find different items I'm looking for in one location</u>. What's more, <u>they keep complementary products in proximity so I don't have to go around the shop several times</u>. Oh, I nearly forgot, it's open round the clock, so I can go there after work on week days, thus, I don't have to make time for shopping at weekends. Instead, I spend more time with friends and family. I'm really happy that now I can do shopping much faster and spend much less money than before."

At some point of my journey, I noticed a dark cloud in a distance. The closer I got, the larger the cloud grew. Soon I realised that <u>it was a thick blanket of smog hanging over the city</u>. What I saw when I arrived was  beyond the limits of my imagination. I was even afraid to leave my car. <u>The whole city was shrouded in smog</u>. Just imagine, <u>it was so thick that I could hardly see my feet as I walked through it</u>. <u>I doubt that people living there were lucky to see the sun every day</u>. <u>Wherever I looked, I saw dark circles of smoke exuding from pipes</u>. Needless to say, there weren't many trees there. <u>Those which I could notice were covered with a thick layer of particulate matter</u>. This means they must have stopped producing oxygen a long time ago. <u>The entire city turned into a biologically dead zone</u>. The river which passes through the city was only used for dumping toxic waste from plants and factories. Swimming there was definitely out of question. So it's perfectly natural that <u>it was really difficult for me to breathe</u>. Several hours after I arrived I started coughing nonstop. I still can't imagine how people could live there for long periods of time. If I lived there, I would suffer from asthma or lung cancer. I mean, I would definitely have some kind of respiratory disease. Fortunately, I had to spend just one day there and couldn't wait to get in my car and drive home."

Finally, last year, my dream came true, and I bought it during the Black Friday sale. The TV itself is fantastic, but the remote control that came with it is a different story. It turned out to be so hard to use that it's been almost a year since I bought it, and I'm still trying to figure out how to use all those features that make this TV ‘smart’. I think this remote control was made to make people doubt their IQ ‘cause, you know, it’s like a mini spaceship control panel. It has more buttons than I know what to do with. <p>Every time I want to watch a show or movie, it turns into a challenge. For example, it has a touchpad that is supposed to make navigation easier, but instead, I find myself accidentally swiping the wrong way and ending up in menus I didn't even know existed. One time, I somehow changed the language settings to French, and I had no clue how to get back to English. I had to google it. </p><p>Plus, I have a really hard time using the back button. It’s too sensitive, so it always causes me to accidentally go back when I didn’t mean to. </p><p>Then there's the voice control feature. In theory, it sounds amazing. Just say what you want to watch, and it appears on the screen. But for some reason, it hardly ever understands me. I’ll say, ‘Play the latest episode of Love is Blind’ and the TV responds with, ‘Playing a documentary about sea turtles’. It's as if the remote has a mind of its own. <p></p>Despite all these challenges, I use the smart TV remote every day. I literally have no choice now. I just keep hoping that one day, I’ll get used to using it, and it will finally feel as smart as it's supposed to be.<br>"
