Currently, I'm working at Manilamed, one the best medical centres here in Manila. As a staff nurse, I'm responsible for lots of different things such as preparing patients for examinations and surgery, observing and recording their conditions, measuring and recording their vital signs and weight, administering medications, preparing rooms, cleaning and disinfecting equipment and instruments, or assisting doctors during surgery. Plus, every day I perform a wide range of tasks to provide care to my patients and resolve their problems. For instance, I feed patients who cannot feed themselves, dress patients with physical challenges, help ambulatory patients walk, turn bedridden patients to prevent pressure sores, sometimes I have to transport patients. You see, there's no such thing as a routine day in a hospital, and you just never know what to expect. It's a very tough job, but I like it.

You know, if I could do the work with my eyes closed, I swear I would die of boredom, and I would quit my job even though it pays really well. So every time my boss gives me a new challenging task, I feel totally psyched. You know, there is just something beautiful about encountering obstacles and finding ways to overcome them. And then every time I finish a difficult project or task successfully, I feel like I’m flying. My confidence skyrockets and I feel proud of myself, which helps me grow both professionally and personally, and expand my comfort zone.

But despite its relatively small size, it offers the same facilities and amenities as a large city does. For instance, we have department stores, schools, cafes, hospitals, to name but a few. So I don't feel trapped. Nor do I feel like I'm stuck in a small town with no opportunities. In my opinion, it's a great place to work, live and raise a family. What I like most about it is that there aren't many vehicles on the roads, so it isn't noisy or polluted. And because there aren't many cars, there are no traffic jams, even during rush hour.

Also, it's well-known for diverse marine life and pristine coral reefs, which entice divers to explore locations such as Pescador Island in Moalboal, known for the sardine run and turtle point, and Oslob, where you can have the incredible experience of swimming alongside magnificent whale sharks. And, of course, I can't help mentioning its unique Cebuano cuisine, particularly lechon, which is a whole pig slowly roasted over glowing coals. It's considered the centerpiece of fiestas, birthday celebrations, and various other joyous occasions in Cebu. "

So it's sometimes referred to as the 'Durian Capital of the Philippines'. Second, the city is famous for its orchids and has lots of orchid farms and nurseries. So it's also known as the 'Orchid Capital of the Philippines'. It even hosts an annual Kadayawan Festival, which includes a floral float parade that showcases the city's orchid varieties and other flowers. Lastly, it's home to many iconic landmarks such as the Philippine Eagle Center, a conservation center for the critically endangered Philippine Eagle, Mount Apo, the highest mountain in the Philippines, the Davao Crocodile Park, and People's Park."

There are these crazy tall buildings that look like they're from the future, like the Kingdom Centre and the Burj Rafal. And then you've got these old-school places that provide a glimpse into the city's past, like the Al Masmak Fortress and the Murabba Palace. And I can't help mentioning the old Diriyah district. It's got these super old buildings and narrow streets that make you feel like you're in a totally different time period. So everywhere you go in Riyadh, you're surrounded by cool stuff that's either really modern or super old. And it's what makes this city so unique and interesting to explore.

First, traffic can be really bad, especially during rush hour, and some parts of the city don't have proper sidewalks so you have to be careful sharing the space with cars. Also, when it rains, the drainage isn't always great so streets can get flooded pretty easily. Lastly, pickpocketing is a common problem here. So you need to keep an eye on your pockets and bags. "

Well, first of all, Ukraine is a large country <u>situated in the heart of Europe</u>. There’s even some place that Ukraine claims to be <u>Europe's geographical centre</u>. It’s not far from Rakhiv, a small town in the Carpathian Mountains. In fact, it’s just a board with an inscription. Another interesting fact I found out about recently is that with 70% of Ukrainian adults having a secondary or higher education <u>Ukraine ranks fourth among the most educated nations, and it has the fourth highest number of certified IT professionals in the world</u>. However, I don’t know how reliable this information is.  Also, <u>one quarter of the world’s black soil reserves are located in Ukraine</u>. And because of its properties our black soil is considered best in the world. <u>Well, what else… the country is washed by the waters of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov</u> in the south. And <u>there’s a mountain range</u> in the west. To tell the truth, I can spend hours speaking about my country."

Simplicity is the best word to describe it. <u>It was extremely thin and light</u>. <u>It had a big screen with high resolution</u> which was neither big nor small. It was smaller than that of iPhone 6S, but bigger than that of iPhone4. <u>There were just four mechanical buttons</u>. This model had <u>a finger recognition system</u>, so in most cases I used touch ID to activate different apps and services, which was a wonderful feature for lazy people like me. To navigate, I used multiple taps and drags. This smartphone had a user-friendly interface. I just loved it. "

To me, modern houses are aesthetically more appealing. I like minimalism in design, you know, geometrical forms and straight lines. Plus, they are better for the environment 'cause they use energy-efficient building materials that, by the way, make modern houses cheaper to keep heated or cooled. Due to this, they are less expensive to maintain, which is no less important than being eco-friendly. Another reason why I prefer living in modern houses is that they are more practical 'cause modern house plans utilize space more efficiently. There is almost no transitional space. And everything feels more connected. Finally, I can't help mentioning one more important thing: modern houses tend to already have modern conveniences, whereas old houses often lack ductwork or central air systems because those technologies simply did not yet exist when they were built."

The rarer the stamp, the more valuable it is, and collectors might even travel far and wide in the search of highly-prized stamps. For example, 'Russian Warship, go... !' has become the most wanted stamp not only in my country, but in many countries all over the world. It was sold on Ebay for 1500 dollars. Classic cars, art, coins, NFTs and celebrity memorabilia are also popular collectible items with a high potential return on investment. I should say collecting cars isn't an option for everybody, but they are considered one of the coolest things to have. Children of all ages collect stickers, coins, badges, squishies, Happy Meal toys, Lego sets."

However, it's not the age of the wearer or the item of clothing itself that makes someone fashionable, but rather how they wear it and how it fits into their personal style. With the right choice of T-shirt, fit, and styling, older people can look stylish and fashionable in a T-shirt. The key is to choose T-shirts that flatter their body shape, complement their personal style, and are appropriate for the occasion."
